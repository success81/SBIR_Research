Our approach represents a significant improvement from state-of-the-art systems, developing a two-armed manipulator system adaptable to the chaotic spaces of the world at a cost equal to or less than a traditional industrial robot. Our Deliverable We propose simulating a two-armed, upper torso humanoid of our Work-Class Perseus effort. We have hardware customers who use our Perseus system for Artificial Intelligence development that would team with our controls effort. Our team would dive directly into controllability studies for the unique and varied tasks and environment of an industrial kitchen. We anticipate that initial tele-operated studies provide proof-of-concept returns which can be de-risked during Phase I before being fully developed into hardware and autonomous behaviors during a Phase II effort. Our concept incorporates and combines previous hardware and controls work of ours in a novel way, allowing a significant impact in modelling and delivering a real-world robotic solution for the chaotic environment of a DFAC. The Rationale Behind Our Approach We have built early prototypes of our Work-Class Perseus Humanoid hardware, but every revision of the system improves the robustness and capability of our already reliable platform. Using this existing platform allows us to focus risk on the execution of tasks instead of the reliability of hardware. We have designed certain foundational control software to match perfectly with our propriety hardware, further reducing the risk pool. This risk reduction allows our controls team to get to work immediately to understand the back-of-house tasks and begin to break those challenges down to a number of simpler behaviors and model, beginning the process of modelling the various tasks from the ground up. Our team would develop a number of strategies in a remote or tele-operation style – proving the path forward to full autonomy during Phase I, allowing us to identify the most powerful, labor-saving, and efficiency improving solutions to take into full autonomy during Phase II. The technical path forward For our path forward, Apptronik in Phase II, will move the control algorithm designs to test and evaluation, shifting from human in the loop tele-operation, to supervision-optional autonomy. We would develop a prioritized function set through end-user dialog and starting with the most significant add autonomy to each behavior in turn down the list."

Dexai's solution significantly reduces health risks for military personnel and food consumers, without compromising on taste or quality. Dexai’s plug-and-play solution consists of a commodity robot arm adapted to kitchen cleanliness standards, machine vision algorithms to recognize ingredients, and machine-learning based manipulation policies to pick and scoop those ingredients. For each item, the robot, nicknamed Alfred, attaches the required utensil (thus satisfying ServSafe allergy requirements), locates the required ingredient based on its live video feed, picks the ingredient with the allocated utensil, and places an accurate portion into the appropriate food container before continuing to the next task. Under this program, Dexai will adapt its existing single-robot salad assembly station, initially conceived for restaurants, into a touchless fully automated solution. This would enable the conversion of existing self-serve food stations, such as salad bars and hot food lines, into hygienic automated stations operated without human touch. Moreover, Dexai will develop a technical plan to extend its automation solution to other activities in the kitchen, such as operating grills, fryers, and other kitchen equipment, or general prepping of raw ingredients.     To do this, Dexai will also develop an intent-based voice and gesture input system, enabling military personnel to place their orders and interact with Alfred without using a touchscreen. Additionally, Dexai will improve the speed and single-pick precision of its manipulation strategies by developing a new machine learning model to supplement existing visual feedback with the robot’s joint torques and velocities. Furthermore, Dexai will develop a technical plan enabling  Alfred to perform other major tasks required for food preparation in industrial kitchens operated by the Department of Defense (DoD). Alfred is built on Dexai's proprietary artificial intelligence technology, enabling it to leverage visual feedback and perform complex tasks required for many different kitchen activities. These tasks include: frying, sautéing, stirring, stewing, baking, grilling, chopping, slicing, dicing, blending, mixing, and more.  During this Phase 1 effort, Dexai will develop a hands-free interface to command Alfred, test the solution in a real environment at Scott Air Force Base, and develop a technical plan to extend Alfred’s capabilities to other kitchen activities.  At the end of this effort, Dexai will deliver a report detailing recommended adaptations of Alfred for Phase 2 work, along with the results of the pilot, no-touch salad bar or hot food line installation of Alfred."

SEATRAIN integrates four core capabilities. First, SEATRAIN’s AI Assistant uses machine learning to coach trainees by showing how their assessments differ from its own assessments and explaining its rationale. The Phase II version will highlight how trainees’ actions differ from its actions and show how proven procedures/techniques guided its actions. Second, SEATRAIN incorporates online learning to help it continually improve its classification performance. Third, SEATRAIN uses machine learning to filter out clutter and perform cluster classification, enabling it to generate timely alerts for valid contacts and anomalous detections—including detections for which there are no reference signatures or training data. SEATRAIN can classify contacts accurately because its computational resources are focused only on relevant detections. Fourth, SEATRAIN is embedded in an extensible fusion architecture that is readily modified to accept new input data (e.g., onboard non-acoustic sensors and external data links) and perform higher levels of fusion/assessment. Adapting SEATRAIN for the operational P-8A ASW mission system will help operators provide more timely, relevant, and accurate tactical information during actual ASW operations."

The VAS will apply state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide quantitative analysis tools to help instructors assess the communications and overall performance and decision-making effectiveness of a mission. The VAS will go beyond simple transcriptions of “what was said” by providing various context-specific analytics to correlate the voice communication with tactical execution for the instructors to provide relevant feedback. Using NLP, it will be able to track and map the mission’s voice communication among the officers, pilots, and shipboard Commander. The VAS will transcribe and time-stamp the voice recordings and produce a meta-tagged and parseable “utterance log” from multiple participants. This utterance log will support the instructors with their assessment and will integrate with the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) Analysis and Reporting Tool (ART) system.  Using the VAS meta-tagged transcriptions, analysts will be able to locate specific actions that occurred during the training scenario and highlight participants’ actions, response times, and decisions. Currently, instructors use manual and qualitative techniques to analyze and correlate the voice communications with other synthetic data logged during the multi associated training scenario and identify areas that need improvement. Using advanced speech technology, the VAS will support assessment automation and help instructors in the following areas: Decrease instructor workload Reduce human error Reduce manpower time requirements Automatically track and map communications to provide information on protocol adherence and timeliness The overall goal of this project is to develop a Voice Assessment System and capability to help accurately measure and analyze task performance at various levels, including individuals, teams, multi-teams, and organizations, and to enhance warfighter performance and effectiveness."

Numerous research papers have looked at ways to incorporate manufacturing constraints within the optimization. This has promise for additive manufacturing but has significant hurdles when subtractive manufacturing is used. There is not a clear sense of what is feasible and what is infeasible in subtractive machining; rather, one can spend a prohibitive amount of time removing minute amounts of material to get ever close to the organic curvy shapes produced by topology optimization. We propose that the best approach to arrive at optimal and manufacturable parts is to first use topology optimized parts without manufacturing constraints and then apply an artificial intelligence search on the result to find suitable solutions. Our approach is also distinguished by the fact that the results will not be a single solution but rather a range of solutions that show a trade-off in manufacturing cost and time versus how well the idealized topology optimized solution is created. The prime organization, Medema Labs, is a recent university spin-out company in Oregon focused on developing commercial software from ten years of academic research in automated manufacturing planning. For this project, the team will build upon a recently published journal article by academic associates, where material is added to the topology optimized part in varying amounts depending on the choice of tool and approach direction. This algorithm will be developed for Medema Labs new desktop tool, Medema PartAnalyzer, which can automate the planning of the entire manufacturing process including the choice of stock size, machine, setup orientations, and tools. The result will be a range of manufacturing plans with varying tradeoffs of added mass and manufacturing costs. We will be working closely with a local high-tech machine shop, Machine Sciences, to ensure that the automated modifications to the topology optimized parts produce can be realistically manufactured.  These solutions could then be used by engineering designers to make informed decisions about cost versus performance. During the Phase I Base Period, the team will demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at modifying topology optimized parts and validate the resulting manufacturing plans by producing 3-axis CNC machined parts.  During the Phase I Option Period, the team will further calibrate the manufacturing plan results and developing the graphical user interface components necessary to make the tool truly useful to engineers. Future phases will focus on adding lathes and four+ axis CNC mills, as well as, enabling importing and exporting to commercial topology optimization and CAM software."

A strategy to mitigate the capability of cognitive jammers (e.g., sophisticated, AI-driven jammers that reacts to measured radar emissions and measure their own effectiveness) is to attempt to model and exploit the decision logic used by the jammers to select electronic protection techniques which mitigate the jammer effects.  Vadum will develop the Adversary Logic Exploitation System (ALES) to probe a cognitive jammer system in order to model the jammer decision logic.  ALES will use the modeled decision logic to schedule subsequent radar waveforms which both produce the information required by the radar and limit the effect of electronic attack on the radar system.  The ALES algorithms will analyze incoming signals and segregate out the likely jamming signals.  Changes in radar behavior which drive changes in jammer behavior are saved in a persistent data structure (the Jammer Behavior Object or JBO) and analyzed.  Based on the inferred understanding of the jammer behavior, subsequent radar waveforms which avoid the effects of the likely electronic attack will be scheduled.  ALES will identify and schedule both electronic protection techniques and probing waveforms to not only protect the radar, but to gain additional information about the jammer. Vadum will develop the ALES algorithms in an in-house modeling and simulation environment which supports concurrent experimentation and development of algorithm prototypes and production of software versions of those same algorithms.  The Phase I effort will prove out the ALES concept sufficiently to support additional Phase II research focused on improving ALES performance by further algorithm development and characterization along with the potential inclusion of algorithms and architectures from other Vadum Cognitive Electronic Warfare programs.  The Phase II program will also increase the maturity of the algorithms themselves through increased testing fidelity to support eventual Phase III transition decisions."

Magnesium (Mg) alloys are candidates for fuel-efficiency applications, especially the aircrafts. They satisfy density, strength, and stiffness for many designs. However, their low corrosion resistance cannot ensure design lifetimes.  This limits them to non-/semi-structural applications in Navy aircrafts. To overcome this limitation, Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes development of AM processable magnesium alloy(s) by data driven Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), their powder production, and property characterizations. Alloy design is a multi-criteria decision-making procedure that matches materials traits with design requirements. At this juncture, ICME emerges as an overarching approach aiming to link processing, microstructure, properties, and performance (PMPP) of materials to design expectations. Present computational alloy design approaches, such as PHAse COMPutations (PHACOMP) and CALculations of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD), require a sequential treatment of several microstructural constituents, thermodynamic properties, mechanical properties, and employment of a multitude number of phase diagrams. Consequently, high fidelity computational thermodynamics/mechanics simulations for multicomponent alloys are still in their infancy. In such a context, ANN appears as a fast and reliable alloy design approach, which can uncover complex correlations between material traits and design criteria."

No.: 42161)   Focus Area: Persistent Space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)   Technical Abstract: The Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectral region (~8 to 12 um) is very important for many military applications such as night vision googles, imaging systems, target acquisition and designation sighting systems (TADS), and forward looking IR (FLIR) cameras in UAVs and for commercial applications such as night vision for automobiles, smart electronics, LIDAR, and gas detection. Conventional optical device materials (lenses) are mostly opaque to wavelengths (> 3 ?m). IR optics are expensive and have low performance compared to visible or near-infrared optical components. In recent years, it was found that optical metasurfaces ie., artificially thin film engineered structures with thickness at wavelength-scale with on-demand electromagnetic driven responses, offer promising cost-effective, high-performance ultra-compact infrared optics. Traditionally, lenses (visible or IR) are curved, heavy and bulky (cm scale), with limited performance, while the metalenses (MLs) are flat (µm scale), reducing much of the distortion, physical size, and weight. Further, MLs can generally be produced using ultra -low cost “Si” world integrated circuit device production lithography. In this SBIR project we will use our MOCVD process to produce the MLs materials and use standard low-cost semiconductor mass production lithography techniques to produce the physical MLs. In Phase I, SMI by working with its project partner CUNY, will design/model production viable LWIR MLs, identify the applications with the Air Force (AF), AF providers; and in Phase II, we will grow and process suitable materials to demonstrate functional LWIR MLs. We will also determine a production optimization plan for Phase III commercialization."

But software deployments to NIPR and SIPR require authentication with Common Access Cards (CACs). CAC authentication is not widely supported in commercial software, especially by innovative start-ups with amazing new technology build on tight budgets. The Air Force needs a way to make it easy for providers of commercial off-the-shelf software to meet CAC authentication regulations. The commercial market is awash in innovative AR/VR training experiences (including lightweight simulators), productivity enhancing AR applications, and Artificial Intelligence technologies. These blocks will build the next generation of training simulations that are both less expensive, more immersive, and more effective than their predecessors. The Air Force is engaging the market to use best-of-breed tools to better equip service members. To that end, the Air Force has white-labeled Dynepic’s DX Platform as MOTAR. This new platform will deliver best-of-breed training and simulator experiences. But if each vendor on the MOTAR platform had to modify its software to be CAC-compliant, the work of adopting CAC authentication would be repeated with every vendor, increasing the cost to the government, and increasing the barriers existing software companies have working with the Airforce. The CAC requirement could slow – or even prevent – the DoD from acquiring the best applications the market can offer.  By adopting Netrist SmartBridge on MOTAR, AR/VR and lightweight simulator vendors will be able to leverage CAC logins through the market-standard authentication APIs they are already support. MOTAR currently supports the market-standard OAuth2 protocol with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single sign-on. This standard was developed by Google and others and is currently widely adopted by most major technology and identity providers (Google, Microsoft, Auth0, Okta, etc.).  Netrist SmartBridge sits behind the OAuth2 / OIDC APIs and enables CAC authentication following DoD standards. It facilitates interactions with the end user and prompts them to authenticate with their CAC without requiring the training vendor applications to be aware of the authentication method. SmartBridge will add CAC authentication to the single sign-on experience while interfacing through the OAuth2 /OIDC APIs. "

The primary source of PNT is the Global Positioning System (GPS) which has been integrated in some fashion to the majority of autonomous systems currently in operation. While ubiquitous and highly useful, this system has issues in operational environments such as indoors, urban environments, mountainous or jungle terrains, or where line-of-site is not achievable by the receivers. Furthermore, in today’s Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) environment, our peer and near-peer adversaries maintain the capability to degrade, disrupt, manipulate, and deny, access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These negative actions result in reduced capability of autonomous systems to navigate and successfully execute their mission. Most UASs/ORBs have a suite of onboard sensors, including Electro-Optical (EO) cameras which provide real-time operational imagery which has the potential to be used to support autonomous position and navigation.  The current state of the art approach is visual odometry, which is a brute force approach to matching real-time imagery with known previously captured and geo-registered datasets.  However, this approach is extremely challenging and impractical due to computational complexity and high bandwidth transmission required to support the real-time image stream from the UAS.   The real-time high-fidelity imagery needs to be streamed to match against a large database of satellite imagery stored in a remote data-server facility. Such transmission requires ubiquitous, uninterrupted, and fast communication channels which will most likely not be available to the UAS. Moreover, matching of aerial images to satellite imagery using computer vision algorithms are known to be sensitive to illumination variations, protective deformations and changes in the scene.   Ubihere is proposing to overcome those challenges through the development of Ubivision, an compact, low-power, low-cost, artificially intelligent camera system.  By applying existing research from The Ohio State University, Ubihere will overcome these challenges and allow for real-time onboard navigation capability for UASs without the need for GPS or high-speed data connections.  The Ubihere proposed system will be capable of supplanting GPS in denied environments or enhancing it in degraded environments.  Ubihere is responding to the Air Force’s published areas of interest for application of dual-use technology to overcome Warfighter challenges. Specifically, the Air Force has published several Focus Areas relevant to the Agility Prime ORB efforts.  These areas include:  FA-03 “Tactical Level Innovation Opportunities”; FA-06 “Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Dual Use Technologies”; FA-15 “eVTOL/UAM (Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing/Urban Air Mobility”"

Given this significant increase in scale and congestion on orbit, and the competition which has been introduced between various nation-states, maintaining the chain of custody from launch, validation of intent, attribution, and resolution of anomalies or actions is of critical importance to both military and commercial operators.  The challenges encompass not just “traffic management” given the huge increase in physical objects in multiple orbits, but “prediction of traffic intent” that will engage military/civilian operators in this crowded and dynamically changing regime.  The ability to not just predict and avoid physical conjunctions with better fidelity will be needed, but the ability to assess an object’s risks (whether intentionally created or an un-intentional anomaly or failure) before it causes problems may now be required.  It is almost impossible for a human centric operations arena that the military or civilian sectors use today (e.g. CSpOC, etc) to respond fast enough to the expected numbers of conjunction alerts and unknown anomalies or maneuvers amongst the un-precedented growth expected in orbit. An artificial intelligence driven system that uses temporally based real-time information that can assess risk/problems and dynamically create courses of options may be the only way to enable human operators to predict then respond to this un-precedented environment.

In 2016, 52% of service members were injured; 19.6% on MSKI profile for 31-90 days, translating into $548 million in direct care costs and 25 million limited duty days. An epidemiology of MSKI among US Air Force Special Tactics Operators (2018) shows 1-year cumulative incidence of MSKIs was 49.2 injured Operators/100 Operators/year. Currently there is no human-centric system to accurately assess the quality of human movement for the design, implementation and tracking of operations that require heavy equipment (such as parachute ergonomics design) for preventive MSK care. For instance, Special Warfare Operators currently carry 150 to 200lbs of equipment while walking to, boarding, and exiting aircrafts. A Special Warfare team carries between 50- 100lbs of gear during combat operations and training with high injury rate. FIGUR8 presents great opportunities to bring data analytics to human-centric training, equipment load, load bearing body location, and other external factors. FIGUR8 Fusion System is a highly accurate, scalable, and wearable hardware and software to measure and apply artificial intelligence (AI) analytics to MSK data.

This technology toolbox could capture posture, balance, lower back and leg muscle outputs outside laboratory settings, enabling relevant data collection reflecting how the load is being distributed over the body, and a scientific evaluation on the location of the load, weight distribution will affect range of motion, muscle activity and agility.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been successfully used to predict QoL/Resilience utilizing broader data sources to reveal underlying issues. Modern research shows that large, broad data sets subjected to AI/data-mining (e.g., consumer behavior, social media interaction, etc.) provides statistically relevant predictive accuracy and intervention strategies. Applied to AF challenges, our approach utilizes varied AI models (Recurrent, Convolutional, and Attention Neural Networks) to determine feasibility of mining common complaints, airmen job mobility/progression, software usage, social media sources, etc. Preliminary tests provide correlation insights between Airmen’s environments and job dissatisfaction, suicide prevalence, and more.

Natural beach processes are not stagnant shorelines but rather dynamic systems that shift, migrate, fill and erode. Accurate seafloor depths and nearshore charts are important for forecasting weather, tsunami, and storm surge events that can impact local communities, infrastructure, and shipping industries. The necessity of safe navigation for civilian ships not rated for ice operations and dynamic geographical needs is driving the need for innovative modeling. Traditional mapping techniques are incapable of updating constantly evolving bathymetric navigation models quickly and accurately to suit the needs of business and communities. AI/ML technology has much to offer and investigate in terms of different architectures, applications and possible modifications. Some of the largest roadblocks to implementing current AI/ML modeling are that they require data, cannot directly include current scientific understandings of systems, and are considered a black box for understanding the way the system is solved. The proposed work will teach AI/ML models to learn from more than just data but also scientific theories, and then to write out solutions that can be interpreted by humans This SBIR project will develop a method to integrate data and models in a dynamic learning environment. Systems using AI/ML have the capability to identify critical patterns in nonlinear, complex systems when good training data is available. However, this process does not create new insights on system dynamics. Beach physics and coastal morphology are actively researched today and have led to high quality traditional coastal modeling codebases, both phenomenologically generated and physics-based, but these are not easily updated. This project will design an architecture using analytical functions and data to develop solutions as a codebase, which can then be reviewed and compiled as a traditional coastal model, allowing for novel AI/ML methods without requiring the user to learn new readable formats.

This patterning technology is based on scanning tunneling microscope instrumentation. Up to now, opportunities for advancing research and its application to manufacturing have been limited due to the poor reliability and lack of automation often associated with scanning tunneling microscopes. This STTR project will develop physics-based artificial intelligence algorithms run on a proprietary operational system which will remove the tedious, time-consuming manual processes to enable a fully autonomous atomic precision lithography process. This will improve the productivity and reliability of research tools and pave the way for highly parallel tools that could be used for manufacturing of products such as quantum computers. In Phase I, artificial intelligence developed image recognition algorithms were created that successfully identified the position of all atoms in a scanning tunneling microscope image of the surface. A defect- detection algorithm was also developed to identify and classify typical defects on the surface - typically a time-consuming manual process. Another success was that an additional algorithm was demonstrated that identified the atomic step edges that are the boundaries of single atomic terraces, making identification highly robust with respect to all possible elements observed on the surface. In Phase II, we will integrate these algorithms into a scanning tunneling microscope control system in order to automate atomic precision lithography, establishing human supervised real time feedback between the operational microscope platform and the Artificial Intelligence system. We also plan to develop process optimization algorithms to improve the speed and performance of the processes including error detection and correction, tip state optimization, elucidation of manipulation conditions, and real time object-based feedback for automated manipulation. The combination of our artificial intelligence combined with our proprietary control system will essentially bring mass production to the quantum scale. Because of the significant boost in federal funding for quantum research via the National Quantum Initiative Act and the much higher and broader level of industrial interest in quantum compared to other nanotechnologies, there will be truly revolutionary new developments in sensing, communication, and computing technologies. This will create a significant boost to the nanolithography research market and open a path for atomic precision manufacturing tools for quantum technologies. Solid state quantum technologies require higher precision than state-of-the-art semiconductor devices and will therefore create a significant business opportunity. Because Hydrogen Depassivation Lithography has dramatically better resolution and precision than even the most advanced semiconductor lithography tools or E- Beam Lithography tools, our team is extremely well positioned to break into this new sector of the research nanolithography market. We have a scanning tunneling microscope control system designed for hydrogen depassivation lithography already on the market which will directly benefit from the technology developed in this program."

They are designed to be self- regulating autonomous systems that do not require a large number of on-site staff. To realize the full benefits of autonomous operation, microreactors need online monitoring systems that provide continuous performance verification of critical components at a level of automation that is not available today in the nuclear industry. In addition, microreactor process conditions are harsher relative to existing light water reactors, and existing nuclear sensors may not be capable of withstanding the long-term effects of these stressors in a microreactor. To avoid frequent sensor replacement as a result of calibration drift or premature degradation, durable alternative sensor technologies must be identified and evaluated for microreactor applications. To facilitate the safe and efficient deployment of microreactors in remote off-grid locations, a research and development effort is proposed involving the testing of sensors and embedded instruments that could be installed within microreactors and used in conjunction with an online monitoring system that verifies the health of critical components. In support of this system, artificial intelligence techniques will be identified and developed specifically for microreactor applications. This work will result in hardware and software to support remote autonomous microreactor operations. The research and development effort proposed herein will employ a hands-on approach to develop an online monitoring system that can be used to support autonomous remote operation of microreactors. During this project, process sensors and embedded instruments that could be deployed in microreactors will be identified, obtained, and tested to determine their capabilities for providing the measurements needed to effectively monitor and control microreactors. Online monitoring technologies for in-situ health monitoring of sensors and processes in microreactors will be identified, developed, and demonstrated in a laboratory environment using real-time measurements and existing nuclear plant data sets. The results from testing and demonstrations will be used to develop a conceptual design of an online monitoring system for microreactors to be built in Phase II.

Around 20% of this energy going to refrigeration is wasted due to the machines’ low energy efficiency. This results in over $4.4 billion lost annually by domestic food businesses. This low efficiency is coupled with low resilience in commercial refrigeration systems. Most food stores lack sufficient backup power or energy storage to continue running their entire refrigeration system in an outage, so they stand to lose $367,000 to over $900,000 in food inventory at each extended power outage. These problems will be addressed with non-invasive retrofit hardware that collects data and hosts the proposed artificial-intelligence-based software to run each building’s commercial refrigeration system in three modes. In fully-powered, normal operation (mode 1), the technology will measure refrigeration temperature and case traffic in real time. With this data the software will generate operational commands that manipulate temperature signals to the refrigeration thermostat, in this way shifting compressor cycles to reduce energy consumption. The technology will also be equipped to pre-cool units when sent a command that harsh weather and potential power outages are predicted (mode 2). For these situations, the proposed solution will preemptively adjust the temperature of certain refrigeration cases to keep food below the industry-critical temperature of 41◦F during impending outages. Finally, during unexpected outages (mode 3), the technology will supply the highest-value assets with backup power (e.g., from battery storage or an onsite generator). Given the typically limited capacity of backup power, the technology will enable food retailers to optimally use backup power and maintain temperature in essential chillers (e.g., meat and dairy cases) while letting less sensitive cases (e.g., soda coolers) heat up gradually. Phase I will design and do initial testing on a proof of concept with machine learning software and hardware that hosts the control software locally. The company will develop software that cleans and analyzes operational data from commercial refrigeration systems and then derives optimized temperature signals from this data. Finally, Phase I will produce hardware that implements these signals by updating temperature settings in a commercial refrigeration unit in real time. To alleviate barriers to adoption and manufacturing challenges, Phase II will involve developing a prototype with a form factor similar to existing commercial refrigeration thermometers. In Phase II, the technology will also be tested and updated to receive wireless commands from a central server, a necessary step for commercialization. At the conclusion of Phase II, the technology will be available to sell as a Software as a Service package to food retail chains."

The forecasts produced by widely varying model approaches are inherently limited in different ways, such as by the number and quality of training observations, producing biased predictions that achieve optimal skill only over specific ranges of weather and river conditions. Thus, despite the growing availability and new sources of forecasts, hydropower owners cannot fully leverage the information because they lack an effective mechanism to determine the “best” forecast for given conditions or objectives. Tools are needed to consolidate forecast information, demonstrate skill, and extract optimal forecast guidance from the range of possibilities. Such tools will increase uptake and beneficial use of the growing wealth of forecast information, and lead to improved operating decisions, optimal power generation, and enhanced system value. This research proposes to improve the value of forecasts by developing a broadly accessible verification framework and applying machine learning techniques to identify the ‘best’ forecast from an ensemble of sources given the current weather, river and operating conditions. In Phase I, we will develop a proof-of-concept framework consisting of three primary components: 1) a data platform based on a unified data management paradigm, 2) a forecast verification system, and 3) AI/ML-based techniques for conditional forecast selection. The data platform and verification framework will build upon an existing foundation, adding enhancements to the architecture to support pervasive accessibility and commercialization potential, such as greater data diversity, cloud-based access, and user self-service interfaces. Phase I work will largely focus on development of the third component, namely AI/ML-based techniques to select the ‘best’ forecast for the current conditions from a set of available forecasts or hybrid of those forecasts. If the proposed research is successful and carried into full build-out in Phases II and III, anticipated public benefits, stemming from the increased uptake and improved use of forecasts by the hydropower sector, include greater reliability of electricity, reduced flood impacts, and enhanced recreation, environmental quality and public safety."

PhD student placement is a great concern for universities. However, in the absence of data-driven tools that can help administrators track PhD student progress and market needs, there is little that university leaders or faculty can do to continually improve PhD programs and align these programs with the needs of the economy. The total addressable market for AI-driven academic guidance for higher education is estimated at over $1 billion annually. By improving the match between PhD academic preparation and the needs of organizations tackling contemporary challenges in knowledge and technology intensive industries, this project will help universities contribute to society’s grand challenges in areas such as energy, food, disease and transportation. The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously gathering adequate data from students, alumni and job postings and using this data to make reliable predictions and actionable individualized recommendations to PhD students that support their academic preparation towards improved market readiness. Education is one of the most important applications of AI, and this project focuses on using AI to empower students, faculty and administrators to maximize the outcomes from the large investments by universities in PhD programs. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to collect highly granular data from PhD students, alumni and job market postings and use this data to build prediction and recommendation models to maximize the match between each student’s interests and market needs across long time horizons beyond graduation. While the market expectations for PhD graduate competencies are evolving rapidly and include high levels of multi-disciplinary excellence, PhD programs are evolving slowly, largely due to the lack of data-driven recommendations for appropriate interventions. The proposed R&D plan will develop semi-automated methods for data curation in higher education, then use this data to build novel algorithms using neural network architectures and techniques to predict career outcomes of PhD graduates. The company will also use this data and upstream models to build individualized recommendations using model-based reinforcement learning. The system will suggest the most suitable actions for students, faculty and administrators to maximize the impacts of PhD programs in all disciplines.

Chest CT procedures play a critical role in COVID-19 patients but current methods for evaluating chest CT images lack accurate, quantitative, or consistent information, leading to text-based reports that are difficult to interpret. The proposed AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow will efficiently capture the fraction of lung involvement and improve communication with clinicians by providing a standardized graphical report, key images of important findings, and structured text. The quantitative data will standardize reporting on an individual patient basis and provide data for population-level analyses, thereby offering the potential to significantly advance scientific knowledge of COVID-19 lung disease on a national level. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow to rapidly and objectively quantify the percentage of lung involvement, classify lung involvement using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS), track common and uncommon COVID-19 lung findings, and automatically generate summary reports with a graph, key images, and structured text. The standard-of-care for assessing and reporting COVID-19 lung disease severity on chest CT images involves dictated text-based reports that are subjective, highly variable, inefficient to generate and interpret, prone to errors, incomplete, and qualitative with data provided in an unstandardized format.

The proposed energy-efficient neural network accelerator solution uses circuit architecture that allows for chips with a small area, a key enabler for cost-effective adoption and inclusion in space-constrained systems such as mobile devices. The solution is energy-efficient compared to the existing digital logic-based accelerator solutions, which will enable edge implementation for systems with power constraints. The manufacturing process is fully scalable in advanced standard logic processes at almost all manufacturing foundries, thus allowing for widespread adoption of the architecture.

This economic constriction puts immense pressure on our rural small landholders to increase economic output per acre. Solar power at small and medium scales must be deployable and not interfere with agricultural production. By developing a price competitive solar racking system, landowners have greater economic stability from multiple income sources while reducing energy price volatility risks. The proposed solution is to design a simple and flexible solar power racking system that spans irrigation canals in an affordable cost‐competitive way. The proposed system leverages pre‐owned and already utilized land, provides benefits of lowering evaporation, increased solar cell efficiency, along with making use of pre‐existing access roads usually along canals. The approach is to employ new technologies in adaptive structural design as a way of finding the absolute lightest, strongest, and cheapest structural solution. By having an installer and consumer‐friendly design that is robust yet light and cheap, the system can easily be installed in mass quantities over irrigation canals all across the Midwest and western states. Our Phase‐1 research outcome was an adaptive structural and solar design that optimally conforms to any canal site and orientation. This design methodology is enhanced with Artificial Intelligence optimization which chooses from thousands of possible design configurations, the most economical final design possible for the client and site. This process folds in structural, energy, and comprehensive pricing calculations, in addition to a life‐cycle cost projection. Our Phase‐2 project will be to build our first full‐scale prototype which will be used to measure any water evaporation and water quality improvements, measure a boost to solar panel production which operate at cooler temperatures, and closely refine the construction assembly process to ensure a fast, safe, and affordable structural product. We will also be conducting a canal impact survey to test and produce new safety compliant procedures for operating canals with solar structures overhead.Development of this system will provide many benefits when adopted in the marketplace. Some of these benefits include; creation of clean energy jobs in rural areas, reinvestment in rural infrastructure systems, water evaporation reduced with less mineralization and fouling of farmlands, stabilization of energy prices, land conservation, reduction of heat‐island effects, and reduced water pumping costs to farmers and communities."

Neuromorphic processing will enable NASA to meet growing demands for applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on-board a spacecraft to optimize and automate operations.nbsp; It has been widely received that the recent success of artificial intelligence (AI) is built on three cornerstones: the advance of algorithms, the acquisition of big data, and the availability of high computing power. To further improve the data processing capability and efficiency, researchers, in general, explore from three orthogonal and complementary aspects: algorithm simplification and compression, computing architectures optimized for specific applications, and novel nano-devices that possess unique electrical properties, e.g., synapse- or neuro-alike behavior. These practices are respectively pursued by research societies of machine learning, computer architecture, and solid-state circuit and device. There lacks thorough and sufficient communications and coordination in between. As an example, the quantization of deep neural network (DNN) models often ignores the physical constraints on nano-devices like resistive memory (ReRAM, aka memristor), whose resistance suffers from different variation levels at different resistance values. The higher resistance level can also minimize the power consumption due to the reduced amplitude of the current participating in the computation.nbsp; Carefully optimizing the quantization scheme of DNNs can achieve both high computational robustness and low power consumption of the ReRAM-based neuromorphic processor."

Project results, including generated data, will be used to develop algorithms for artificial intelligence (AI) which will ultimately automate monitoring of experiments as well as life support systems on the International Space Station (ISS), the Lunar Gateway, and beyond.Initially, SPEC Sensors will demonstrate a platform for AQ monitoring in a form factor compatible with autonomous robots such as the Astrobee, currently in use aboard the ISS National Laboratory. In this phase, ground-based laboratory evaluations will be performed with a mobile prototype to address flight certification requirements necessary for integration with the current Astrobee fleet, and for safe delivery to the ISS National Lab by Magnitude.io. These experiments will also generate the training data for the proposed machine learning algorithms developed by the University of Missouri ndash; St. Louis. The complexity of these algorithms will determine hardware requirements for the final phases of the project. For example, a reference array mounted on a mobile robot, in conjunction with remote fixed arrays will require a unique implementation of edge-computing methods and mesh-compatible hardware.In Phase II, the platform will perform passive AQ monitoring from the payload bay of an Astrobee during sorties on the ISS. The temporal, spatial, and physical environmental data collected from these flights will generate real training data for machine learning development, and require minimal support from the stationrsquo;s crew. Finally, in Phase III of this project, with updated software and hardware, this system will be provided to NASA and the ISS National Lab for integration into current and future operational systems. With the successful demonstration of this technology, we expect other needs will arise that can be solved with this AI enabled array."

Fixed site measurement stations are large and expensive. More dense networks of small low-cost sensors are needed to better protect public health.

PM2.5 is an accepted standard for particulate matter (PM) measurements, but PM2.5 mass measurements alone cannot identify sources in-situ. In near-source biomass and wildfire impacted regions, Black Carbon and Organic Carbon are a significant portion of PM and are major contributors to the PM2.5 burden in the air. Black Carbon has been identified as one of the key constituents of PM2.5 and likely a causal agent of respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

Diesel particulate matter, a known carcinogen and a significant source in urban areas, impacts health around the world. Low-cost PM sensors use a light scattering measurement technique which cannot detect particles below 0.5-1.0 micron (0.3 micron at best) in diameter and thus do not detect much of the emissions from fresh diesel combustion. This means that low-cost sensors and networks are likely not collecting any data related to fresh DPM and for PM in these small size fractions. Detecting toxic sub-micron diesel particulate matter and fine I ultra-fine particles from other sources is important in understanding health and providing accurate mass concentration data. Combining low cost PM sensors with AethLabs microAeth® Aethalometer® technology and advanced multi-sensor calibration algorithms using artificial intelligence techniques has significant advantages over the existing sensor platforms that are currently available.

We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype sensor platform with sensor devices that integrate an optical particle counter with PM1. PM2.5, PM10 measurements, Black Carbon and CO2 sensors. The eventual commercialized device and the supporting cloud based data system has applications not just in wild land fire applications but in emerging smart city and community monitoringapplications.

We estimate an opportunity in the United States for state and local agency sensor monitoring networks of between 20,000 and 350,000 sensors. Assuming that the USA might account for½ of the total market. we believe that the global addressable market is between 60,000 and 1,060,000 sensors valued between $30MM to $530MM depending on the final configuration and price of the final commercialized device."

NNs are used as function approximators, learning the complex relationship between spacecraft state and the costates defining the OC to return to a reference trajectory.nbsp;The NNEP technology builds on the variety of technologies that exist for onboard navigation (such as GPS, CAPS, or OpNav). Once the spacecraft has generated a state estimate, it evaluates a pre-trained NN to find the corresponding costates (non-physical terms created in the process of solving an OC problem). The NNEP technology maps state errors to costates because the costates are always smoothly-varying, even for non-smooth OC. Within seconds of the nav update, the spacecraft autonomously determines the control required for the next several days and checks for constraint violations.The NNEP technology consists of both a novel application of NNs to relevant astrodynamics problems and an architecture for implementing this technology in real operational environments and in flight software (FSW). A proof of concept of the technology was developed during Phase I, including demonstration of the building blocks for a FSWnbsp;implementation.

In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled.
BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to
64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in
achieving andamp; maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found
unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class
artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in
optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine
upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve andamp; maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT
[optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to

Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led
to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of
treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the
Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized andamp; sustainable solution with the goal of

More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These
degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as
optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and
management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to
the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial
intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new
demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately,
current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in
ophthalmology,
Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create
an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend
the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin
(MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications
in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with
traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578
fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE
to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including
the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud)
REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c)
Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate
and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational
Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster,
with less frustration, and greater confidence.
Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While
the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical
endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of
image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic.Project Narrative
With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or
glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests
of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access
and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated
platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data. If we meet our
objectives, our platform will reduce the cost of clinical research and increase the speed of translating critical
research insights to saving the sight of millions of patients."

to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT
training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using
scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team
performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT
emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement
of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders
and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for
association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of
18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results.
These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance
related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined
key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders
using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable
platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles
(police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters
and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create
real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be
dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence
analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific
key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of
emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences
of these events.Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios,

The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves
for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD).
Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States
with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for
advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD
recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically-
significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems
(TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low
energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with
increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue.
Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting
energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly
greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced
energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s
UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo
array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal,
and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of
clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology
was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue
depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless,
UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical-
grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries.
Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an
acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours.
This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal
is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may
also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in
multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care.Project Narrative
Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and
bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband
technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and
energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of
life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics
of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations."

The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves
for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)
biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors.
Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States
with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home
monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes
and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to
remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body.
Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic
waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves
and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled
to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram
other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and
communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet.
An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using
continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions
individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote
monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements
using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy
transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo
experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and
energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure
data.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize medicine by improving productivity, reducing human
error, and assisting with diagnosis and treatment. Image classification algorithms can be used to develop
automated visual evaluation (AVE): a potential game-changer for cervical cancer prevention in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs). AVE technology reads digital photographs of a cervix to provide diagnosis
and treatment recommendations in seconds. AVE is a true point of care test, low cost and does not require a
laboratory. AVE could be used either for stand-alone primary screening, or to triage HPV-positive women. We
will compare AVE to common screening methods in LMICs: visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and
conventional cytology. Enhanced Visual Assessment (EVA) System by MobileODT is a cloud-connected
mobile colposcope on a smartphone platform. It is FDA cleared and used in 42 countries. MobileODT is
uniquely poised to integrate AVE into the EVA System.
Our aim is to validate and commercialize AVE on the EVA platform. Phase I aims will adapt AVE to run on the
EVA system using an optimal neural network architecture, running either directly on the phone or as a cloud-
based service. Phase II is a prospective clinical trial of 10,000 patients recruited at ministry of health sites in El
Salvador. All screen-positive patients, and 10% of negative patients, will undergo colposcopy with biopsy.
Sensitivity of AVE as a primary screening test will be compared to cytology and to VIA. In HPV-positive
women, AVE will be compared to VIA as a triage test.PROJECT NARRATIVE

The ready availability of
synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for
elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which
can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value.
Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which
are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template-
independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA
strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by
the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases
to incorporate 3andapos;-blocked nucleotides.In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a
synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc.,
an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining
forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to
discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium
will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all
possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the
resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best
2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Geneticsandapos; proprietary Function Generator technology
and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will
be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset
resulting from this work will be used to train Denoviumandapos;s sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate
further enzyme improvements in Phase II.The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for
enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The
enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications,
and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers.Project Narrative
The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the
industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and
represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome
limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules
that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA
polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel

Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts
on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of
factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent-
child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms,
whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention
of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories
in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent-
child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home
visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility,
generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore,
limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services
render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily
accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support
is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional
appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in-
time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to
identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday
life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to
their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables,
our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect
psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the
current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic
response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion,
and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build
software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine
learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child
mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical
trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing
symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models
with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Mental health problems in childhood are highly prevalent and impairing, placing an immense social and economic
burden on society. Parent-child relationships in the early years of life play a critical role in promoting child mental
health, with critical and coercive relationships increasing the risk of mental health problems across the lifespan.
Our project includes the creation and systematic evaluation of an innovative technology-based therapy system
that employs artificial intelligence to monitor and responsively administer dynamic (i.e., as needed) supports to
families in real-world settings in order to promote positive family relationships and improve child mental health."

As a result of recent and rapid advances of immunogenetical, artificial intelligence (AI) and big
data technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of donor-recipient immunogenetical matching are
expected to be significantly improved. As such, traditional tissue banking practices are being
severely challenged due to low cryopreservation throughput. Skin allograft transplantations are
currently utilized for numerous clinical applications. In such applications, donor tissues are now
typically utilized as “expensive bandages”, i.e. for temporary coverage, thereby requiring painful
and damaging follow-on autotransplantation procedures. With tremendously improved skin graft
cryopreservation methods coupled with use of HLA matching based on AI network, future tissue
banking platforms can potentially provide grafts to be used as permanent and definitive treatment
for patients, thereby bringing high impact to clinical applications and the healthcare industry.
Based on CryoCrate’s novel ultra-fast (106 K/min on a sample surface) cooling technology
platform (PCT/US2019/26162), this project aims to develop a highly efficient (approaching 100%
post-thaw viability) tissue graft cryopreservation prototype system that requires no cryoprotectant.
The post-thaw viability and functionality will be assessed by standard in vitro assays using porcine
and human skin (research exempt) grafts and in vivo assays using a mouse model. After
achieving these aims, in future phase II and III stages, CryoCrate and its academic collaborator
will collaborate with a local Organ Procurement Organization (Mid-America Transplant) and a
wound healing clinic (University of Missouri Hospital) for porcine and human skin transplantation
studies and clinical trials.Narrative
A novel skin graft cryopreservation technology that requires no cryoprotectant will be developed to
significantly improve efficiencies for tissue banking and allograft transplantation practices. This project
initiates collaboration between CryoCrate LLC and local stakeholders, and thereby paves a path to
commercialization of a new generation of ultra‐fast tissue cryopreservation devices."

moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused
balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a
motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing
relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas
with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP
recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always
available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping
professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental
health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These
innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of
the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and
accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by
engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement
program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of
professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system
would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the
significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this
new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for
other teen challenges might also be promising.Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the
past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive
necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen
depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time

manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease
modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective,
there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with
high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD
is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and
cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older
adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured
by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile
application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these
parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable
AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk
individuals.
GaitIQ™ is an innovative digital health startup company developing an online software-based
product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate
spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM
collaborates with The Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at
UT Health San Antonio and Southwest Research Institute for this SBIR project.
The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait
captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high
diagnostic accuracy for pre-clinical AD in a sample of Hispanic older adults.
The project will develop and validate the capacity of GaitIQ™ to detect a digital gait biomarker
signature that distinguishes between individuals with preclinical AD and controls.
The final digital platform will be an easy-to-use, powerful tool to identify and monitor patients with
pre-clinical AD using just an iPad/tablet to video their gait and submit it for analysis in the cloud

advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with
current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on
collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested
peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology
called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with
Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down
communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same
ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available
ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives
cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has
ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition,
fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein
and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to
maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute
Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to
transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has
already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to
effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on-
the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell
and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins,
enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the
biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of
macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our
ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as
being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative
fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH
investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches
for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still
challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to
develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will
improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart
disease and neurodegeneration."

Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted
life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden
of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct
medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become
global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s
population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce
our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current
vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a
given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of
unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu
strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain-
restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT),
involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the
immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT
approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now
focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental
antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted
process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the
ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using
methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than
previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength”
scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant
antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose
to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1)
dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the
immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow-
up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for
translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation.NARRATIVE
Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and
healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and
death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating
viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we
combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing
Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a
broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program
called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions
that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection
stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual
reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal
models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement
into IND-enabling studies."

present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from chest pain to shortness of breath, syncope, or seizure.
Currently, physicians can assess for this condition with a blood test (D-dimer) which has high sensitivity but
very poor specificity, thus resulting in a larger number of false positives. Alternatively, or in the case of a
positive D-dimer, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan can
be used, both of which are expensive and expose the patient to a significant amount of ionizing radiation. To
develop a more specific blood test for PE, Biocogniv will apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to
aggregate analysis of existing blood biomarkers measured on two commercially available multiplex
immunoassay platforms, one of which is currently used in hospital labs. A sufficiently accurate, rapid and
cost-effective test could be broadly applied (i.e., like troponin-I for myocardial infarction) to reduce overuse of
CT, simplify ED decision making, and reduce the number of deaths from unrecognized PE.
In this proposed Phase I single center study, Biocogniv will collaborate with the University of Vermont Medical
Center (UVMMC) to demonstrate proof-of-concept for diagnosing PE in emergency department (ED) patients
for whom there is sufficient concern for PE to warrant a D-dimer test as part of routine clinical care. Specific
Aim I is to collect blood from 225 emergency department (ED) patients at UVMMC who were suspected of
having PE (including 75 patients that are confirmed to have PE by CTPA), and analyze the blood plasma with
quantitative immunoassays to create training and validation datasets for AI analysis. Immunoassays will be
comprised of a set of 6 rapid FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays performed in parallel, and a
20-plex bead-based immunoassay panel targeting known cardiovascular and inflammatory markers associated
with acute PE. Specific Aim II is to develop AI data models for two pretest populations—all D-dimer tested
patients and just D-dimer positive patients—for bead-based and point-of-care immunoassay datasets
(analyzed separately), then evaluate the performance of each data model on a subset of blood plasma data
withheld for validation. As part of the evaluation of AI data model performance, the potential impact of study
size on data model accuracy will be simulated by plotting specificity as a function of training sample number to
show that adding more samples can improve test results. The performance of each approach (i.e., AI
methodology applied to a given immunoassay panel for a given pretest population) will be compared and used
to plan a Phase II multi-center study and to identify and attract a suitable instrumentation partner.
Biocogniv’s end goal is to develop a rapid, highly specific and sensitive FDA cleared test for PE that will
become the standard of care for initial diagnosis and triage of patients with potential pulmonary embolism,
disrupting the $2B/year D-Dimer market and improving ED patient care.Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that presents with non-specific symptoms (including
chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting) and is notoriously difficult to diagnose: as many as 1 in 3
Emergency Department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with PE are initially mis-diagnosed, and up to 1 in 3
PE deaths are only discovered upon autopsy. Biocogniv seeks to develop a new blood test for PE that is just
as sensitive as the existing D-Dimer test, but that also has the higher specificity needed to screen and stratify
all emergency department patients with PE-like symptoms. The expected impact of such a test would be to
increase patient safety by reducing the overuse of radiative imaging, standardize clinical care processes,
reduce costs and save lives."

care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also
suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor
model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing
electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients
are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network
include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and
compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of
algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on
existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate
with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching,

of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative
technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in
patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist
interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as
literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be
deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for
algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of
patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation.The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence
driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention
strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid
use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics
platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention
strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S."

Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130
Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which
effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing
mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial
phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of
mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for
effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most
commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively
assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array
and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will
provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world
settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the
outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially
available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists
of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically
validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction
algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance
and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated
into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which
will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on
developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to
demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage
extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate
performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of
relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions.PROJECT NARRATIVE
To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use
and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable
device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths
and relapses."

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early
detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography
screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram
images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population,
99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality
on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year
in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are
largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing
use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer
detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution,
there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful
field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to
achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to
create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and
robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box”
answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model
performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will
conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim
is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams
into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for
screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired
performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and
accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of-
the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography.Project Narrative
Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges
with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or
unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and
efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality
mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas."

More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney
transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate
contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or
discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by
pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to
significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being
discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team
developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor
kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply
the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with
accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have
also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy
whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy
evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in
optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs.
The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard
for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team
of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal
will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the
automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic
damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to
withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different
laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond
the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT
Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the
kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists
is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage,
present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being
used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist
pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in
more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy
kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant."

Assessing the effectiveness of substance abuse rehabilitation, where high relapse rates create
financial and social tolls, is a pressing clinical problem in need of better measurement tools.
The ability to identify cognitive changes should improve outcomes but current intake into
rehabilitation programs doesn’t typically include cognitive tests. Simple, quick, cost-effective,
and objective measures are needed. This is the problem this proposal seeks to address.
This proposal utilizes the experience of Evolve Behavioral Health which serve 150 patients
weekly, and WAVi, a commercialized brain-assessment platform that combines EEG evoked
responses (ERP) with 5 other tests also sensitive to addiction (heart rate variability, physical
reaction times, MoCA, Trail Making, and Flanker). This user-friendly platform focuses on
minimizing testing times and cost while maximizing information. Our first premise is that
adding these tests will help us identify those addicts whose cognitive state requires modified
treatment approaches, and this will decrease relapse rates and recidivism rates.
Our second premise is that we can create a dataset that can be trained to identify appropriate
treatment regimens on an individual basis from the initial baseline test. To date, WAVi data
have shown ERP to be highly sensitive to concussion (another cognitive issue) and that
artificial intelligence on raw EEG can classify both PTSD and musculoskeletal pain with high
sensitivities and specificities.
The aims of this project are to develop a scalable EEG-based test for rehabilitation facilities
that is readily accessible to clinicians and to create a dynamic data asset to help longitudinally
predict outcomes. Accomplishing these aims will assist clinicians on the front lines of
substance abuse assessment and treatment.Narrative
This project will help create an objective and clinically accessible test to be used in
substance-abuse rehabilitation programs to assist clinicians in making intervention
choices as well as determining the timing of release from rehabilitation."

Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a
third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable
image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor
detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and
even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent
identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional
safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal
intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous
GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While
initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium
deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has
recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI,
and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further
assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by
developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence
(AI) and deep learning (DL).
Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to
develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using
pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard
GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL
software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method
that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free
acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate
and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild-
to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized
full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed.
Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and
zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with
advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more
patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after
contrast-enhanced MRI.Project Narrative
Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create
indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and
function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease
from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition
in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function. This project aims to address
these problems by developing and validating low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced
MRI using deep learning."

The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical
care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside
monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a
tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a
significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical
data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical
Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high-
volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables.
Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific
MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry
errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the
available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is
a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project
will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records
data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using
a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements:
[i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which
receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing
external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will
overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to
hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously
only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time.Narrative
MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool
to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in
hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR
application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors
to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence
algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general."

The opioid epidemic is the U.S.andapos;s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of
deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic.
Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a
fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a
dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who
are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: Americaandapos;s Startups
and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at
UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software
platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients
by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to
show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to
interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform
features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk
assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software
solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for
use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in
primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user-
centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a
“stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes
across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment
of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date
for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered
by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic.Project Narrative
With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose,
the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health
problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly
efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team
portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote
connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track
proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize
a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving
opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and
return on investment."

and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In
the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears:
ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon
has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in
immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the
patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very
difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct
real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable
passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose
to the following Specific Aims.
Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial
measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors.
Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements.
Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new
technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented
biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven
physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity,
gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient
experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven
algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and
intervention for high risk patients.The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle
activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful
completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients
guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple
biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for
providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes
in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and
rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed
challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new
shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an
emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for
two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and
test our innovative technology.Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older
than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from
10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon
has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will
develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the
patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for
retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative
period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery."

The people at greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get
life-saving medication. Justice-involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk
of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these
individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to
reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an
increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to
receiving bup for these individuals are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual
motivation. Our prior research shows that delivering individual level treatment engagement
interventions increase the rate at which individuals receive bup. Thus, our solution is to
improve engagement in bup treatment among justice-involved individuals by 1) “disrupting”
system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are
stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral by using an artificial intelligence
(AI)-based chatbot to make the referral, and 2) addressing low individual motivation by
programming the chatbot to deliver the BNI itself, without the need for a trained professional.
Aim 1: Design and develop a functional prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement.
Milestones: (a) human-centered design (including focus groups) with all stakeholders; and (b)
creation of a functional chatbot using ML and NLP that is integrated with a mobile application,
an application program interface server, and an administrator portal.
Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to BNI Chatbot
or Treatment-as-Usual (TAU).
Hypothesis 1. The BNI Chatbot group will have a higher percentage of participants attending
their first bup appointment than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Primary outcome).
Hypothesis 2. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of readiness and
intention to engage in bup treatment, and lower opioid use, as measured by urine toxicology
tests, than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Secondary outcomes).
Hypothesis 3. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of satisfaction than the
TAU group.PROJECT NARRATIVE

1 in 3 seniors in the United States dies with dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common
form. AD patients suffer from decreased ability to meaningfully communicate and interact, which causes
significant stress and burden for both professional caregivers and family members. Socially assistive robots
(SARs) have been designed to promote therapeutic interaction and communication. Unfortunately, artificial
intelligence (AI) has long been challenged by the speech of elderly persons, who exhibit age-related voice
tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of consonants, increased variability of fundamental frequency, and
other barriers that can be exacerbated by the neurological changes associated with AD, further complicated by
common environmental noises such as the ceiling fan, television, etc. Because of the resulting poor real-world
speech and language understanding by available SAR technologies, scarce human caregivers are often
required to guide AD patients through SAR interactions, limiting SARs to small deployments, mostly as part of
research studies. Unlike existing approaches relying purely on AI, care.coach™ is developing a SAR-like
avatar that converses with elderly and AD patients through truly natural speech. Each avatar is controlled by a
24x7 team of trained human staff who can cost-effectively monitor and engage 12 or more patients
sequentially (2 simultaneously) through the audio/visual feeds from the patient’s avatar device. The staff
communicate with each patient by sending text commands which are converted into the avatar’s voice through
a speech synthesis engine. The staff contribute to the system their human abilities for speech and natural
language processing (NLP) and for generating free-form conversational responses to help patients build
personal relationships with the avatar. The staff are guided by a software-driven expert system embedded into
their work interface, which is programmed with evidence-based prompting and protocols to support healthy
behaviors and self-care. This SBIR Fast-Track project will leverage the unique data generated by our human-
in-the-loop platform to develop new ASR capabilities, enabling fully automatic conversational protocols to
engage and support AD patients without human intervention. We aim in Phase I to leverage our unique prior
work dataset to train an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine to enable the understanding of certain
types of elderly and AD patient speech more successfully than any currently available engine. We aim in
Phase II to incorporate this new engine along with an NLP module into our existing human-in-the-loop avatar
system, recruiting a population of AD patients to further train and validate with during a 2-year human subjects
study so that we can demonstrate full automation of a significant portion of our avatar conversations with mild-

our new ASR/NLP engine as the most accurate platform for enabling the next generation of AD-focused SARs.Narrative
Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been challenged by the speech of elderly persons, and especially persons with
dementia, due to age-related voice tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of consonants, increased
variability of fundamental frequency, and other barriers. Unlike existing approaches to socially assistive robots
(SARs) relying purely on limited AI for conversation, care.coach™ has been commercializing a SAR-like avatar
that converses with elderly and AD patients through truly natural speech, powered by a 24x7 team of trained
human staff. The unique data sets that our solution enables us to gather at commercial scale will be leveraged
in this SBIR project to develop an automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP)
engine that is best-in-class for AD applications, improving the commercial scalability of our avatars by reducing
our dependence on human staff, while serving as a new AI platform for enabling the next generation of AD-
focused, conversational SARs."

Linking computers over conventional “classical” networks enhances computational power by distributing processing tasks by exchanging data bits and then aggregating the results. For a quantum network, quantum bits or “qubits”) replace classical bits and introduce the potential for perfectly-secure data transfer of information between classical computers and the possibility of exponentially-increased computational power when networking multiple quantum computers. The first quantum network will consist of a series of nodes connected by quantum channels, however the lack of availability of key components—such as quantum memory units—present a technological roadblock to this implementation. Qubits can be implemented in either atomic or photonic quantum states. Photons are ideal for transmitting the quantum information but are difficult to store. Conversely, qubits in isolated atomic systems exhibit long storage times, but offer only limited transmission to the chip or tabletop scale. To enable the transfer of quantum information over an existing telecommunications-fiber network, the first quantum random access memory unit will be implemented. This memory will controllably transfer quantum information from photons to atoms and back to photons following a scalable architecture with high throughput. In Phase I, a single quantum memory unit will be demonstrated with a bandwidth, fidelity, and efficiency compatible with large-scale quantum networking applications. The design will follow a scalable photonic architecture for implementation of multiple registers in Phase II. A successful quantum memory will enable the first quantum networks to link multiple classical computers over a fundamentally secure communication lines. These links will have immediate impacts on national security and financial sectors where communications security is critical. Creating quantum networks will allow the United States to catch up with foreign countries such as China) that already have established operational quantum communication systems. A larger benefit to research, business, and society as a whole will likely be seen when multiple quantum computers are realized and linked using a quantum network. Cooperative communication of quantum computers communicating over the quantum network enables a single, larger computer with more qubits and enables exponential increase in computational power. These computational increases can perform quantum simulations that may speed up drug discovery, improve weather forecasting and climate change predictions, as well as benefit the development of artificial intelligence."

We will advance the science behind grafting of botanical DNA taggants to NCC, along with its application to semiconductors and microchips. Our counterfeit detection system is based on the random color pattern formed by the duplexed DNA-NCC hybrid material. The random pattern which is unique to every tag cannot be replicated or reengineered or counterfeited. Further, the random pattern once formed as a solid NCC thin film retains the pattern throughout its life. Machine learning algorithms will be developed to quickly identify microscale optical iridescent/fluorescence patterns and the design of the rapid detection system based on polarized optical microscopy. At the front-end, our detection system only requires a circular polarized Ultra-Violet (UV) light for reading the tag. The back-end of the detection system is protected by a sophisticated machine learning algorithm and a database system that takes advantage of the random distribution of the DNA taggants within NCC film during grafting and the tag manufacturing. In Phase I, we will conduct analysis, design, and fabrication of hybrid DNA-NCC tags. The feasibility study is expected to include the following items: 1) read and interpret signature hybrid DNA-NCC tags with a yield of greater than 95%, 2) incorporate artificial intelligent (AI) machine learning to predict issues of counterfeiting, and 3) distinguish between defect-free hybrid DNA-NCC tags and one with defects included."

The same dangers could impact our nation’s federal and defense computing systems, which are at risk with grave consequences if their security is compromised. Unfortunately current countermeasures using conventional protection methods have difficulties keeping up with new, sophisticated and mutated forms of adversarial cyberattacks. The Phase-I project develops the Trio System for cybersecurity with advanced artificial-intelligence (AI) technologies that enable self-learning for absorbing relevant data, automating detections of cyber threats, known or mutated or newly devised, and empowering organizations, federal and defense departments to more effectively identify threats. The technologies to be developed include (classical) Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Network (NN) algorithms to provide a modern mechanism for the detection and prevention of cyber intrusions and anomalies in all enterprise and industrial-control-system networks. In addition, the developed self-learning and automation features can support the tasks of relieving cybersecurity personnel from having to sort through large sets of detection results, which presently can lead to “alert fatigue”."

It works by transmitting a serial symbol sequence in parallel over many orthogonal subcarriers, which enables longer symbol duration and simpler channel equalization. However, OFDM suffers from a high peak to average power ratio, which typically leads to clipping and an elevated bit error ratio (BER) when processed with linear detectors, as well as multi-path fading due to scatterers and the motion of the transmitter and receiver. When the BER becomes too high for forward error correction to compensate, the signal connection must be reestablished and previously transmitted data is lost, greatly curtailing the overall data throughput. It is therefore desirable to develop a nonlinear algorithm to correct for the effects of clipping and fading so the BER remains acceptable and renegotiation of the link is not required, thus improving overall data throughput. The RACER concept is a proposed machine learning framework to perform nonlinear processing of the received signal to maintain acceptable BERs that can be compensated for with forward error correction."

This research will seek to understand the extent to which an artificial intelligence (AI) can learn to make resource allocation decisions from the experience gained by interacting with a simulated battlespace. First, a simulation-based learning framework will be developed by combining Toyon’s SLAMEM simulator with the open-source projects Gym and TensorFlow. SLAMEM will model a complex mission-of-interest for the Navy and be used to generate training data “episodes” to support the reinforcement learning process. Gym and TensorFlow will deliver a reinforcement learning architecture that supports the parameterization of the AI action policy using a deep neural network. Next, Toyon will design and implement the proof-of-concept Decentralized Unmanned Resource Allocation Artificial Intelligence (DURA-AI) within the new framework. The AI will makes resource allocation decisions in a decentralized architecture to support the mission. The quality of decisions will be quantified by defining a reward function from which the AI will learn good decisions from bad ones. The proof-of-concept AI will be demonstrated and its performance will be measured at the conclusion of the Phase I program."

Conventional edge detection techniques result in too many false positives; this is because they are not cognizant of shape and have no awareness of the photometric characteristics of physical objects or topographical features. An automated system that could reliably monitor data streams for “normal” or expected behavior, and more importantly, reliably identify anomalies or unusual objects would be highly desirable. Vy has developed a powerful set of algorithms collectively called Shape Based Modeling Segmentation (SBMS.) We apply transparent and auditable mathematical models (Bézier curves and decision trees) to collect hard data from visual imagery that significantly increases the speed and accuracy of object recognition.

Metron will create a mission scenario to use as a canvas for employing data mining and ML algorithms, and for determining the tradespace where incorporating big data mining, filtering, and tactically relevant cueing increases mission performance. The main vignette will require sifting through many tracks to find a covert surveillance ship amongst legitimate cruise and container ships.  This mission scenario will include simulation using the Executable Architecture Management System (ExAMS), which seamlessly integrates a data-centric framework with a robust mission simulation tool.  It provides traceability between changes to sensor performance, data architecture, and information flow to mission impacts tested in a discrete-event, Monte Carlo simulation environment.   ExAMS has sophisticated tracking algorithms and information management functionality, which will allow it to serve as an excellent surrogate for MFoS.  Phase I will inform the following objective questions: How can the availability of additional sensor feeds and big data analytic techniques help an operator perform tactical tasks such as finding dark targets, identifying anomalous behavior, and confirming ID?

Knowledge Engineering refers to the process of extracting knowledge from subject matter experts, developing a Knowledge Representation (KR), and building a system based on formal and informal facts, rules, and frames. Scott Higgins, Robert Watkins, Anthony Gaskins, and Dan Shaffer, who collectively have tremendous expertise in surface, air, & subsurface warfare, ballistic missile defense, weapons systems, and more, at an own ship level and at a group/staff level, will provide subject matter expertise. These experts have served on various ships in several positions including Tactical Action Officer (TAO), Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC), Anti-Submarine Warfare Coordinator (ASWC), and Commanding Officer (CO). Fuzzy Logic captures rules that reference qualitative, inexact, or “fuzzy” values such High/Medium/Low. Behavior Transition Networks create intelligent behaviors by dividing behavior hierarchically into tasks connected by transitions. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) attempts to solve the current problem by retrieving a previously encountered similar problem and adapting that problem’s solution to the current situation. Deep Learning refers to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with many hidden layers. Specifically, deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of ANN, are used extensively for Computer Vision applications. Part-based models decompose an object into a set of parts, modeling the local appearance of each part individually and then constraining the relative spatial configuration of the parts. Template matching uses robust features (e.g., histograms of oriented gradient (HOG)) to match new images against characteristic templates."

The Dtangle™ Application provides a unique ability to create a real-time (dynamically) extensible and evolvable applications based on a user defined Domain Specific Languages (DSL) capable of creating unique processes and data models. The real-time capability is enhanced by the vector (pointer) structure of the Dtangle created applications. The vector architecture performs up to five times faster than traditional logic approaches. Dtangle’s unique dynamic capability allows for on-the-fly run-time target application evolution, able to keep up with changing processes and data models. This is a new innovative capability allowing for dynamic updates, extensions, and/or modifications without requirement of extensively rewriting or scrapping previously developed code.  Every decision creates a vector which ties it to the correct procedure to be executed. Dtangle works in concert with its AnyView Modeling capability to create process and data views. While generating C, C++, and Object Pascal in a Windows and Linux environment. An added feature provided by Dtangle is the literal support for application’s evolution using Artificial Intelligence. Whereas most descriptions of Artificial Intelligence are metaphorical, the Dtangle approach is much more literal in its advanced structure. The advanced structure is based on Coherent Object System Architecture (COSA), a unique and powerful architecture that eliminates the complexity of the if-then-else (ITE) code of traditional applications. Schema: Dtangle creates the data model integral to the process model. That is, inherent in the process structure, the data model is quantitively and qualitatively integrated. Dtangle generates all its constituent software structures and component data elements. The user, as the domain expert (AKA – SME), describes the tactical and operational characteristics of all battlespace entities using the Distributed Data Model Markup Language (DDML) of Dtangle. The DDML is in the form of the user’s own terms as a DSL. Using Dtangle, the Distributed Common Operational Picture (DCOP) data model can be included in operational and tactical parameters, maneuvering capabilities, sensors, weapons, and off-board tactical and operational data sources. Dtangle generates C, C++, and Pascal along with the supporting data structures to create an application. The Pascal application will compile with Delphi or Lazarus on Windows or Linux. Dtangle is built using Dtangle. The Dtangle application is being used to create other applications, including robot models, Extract-Translate-Load (ETL) database applications, a DataPress™ application, and a document processing application."

RTS games are characterized by their imperfect information, large state and action spaces, and necessary balancing of high and low-level planning. The conceptual underpinnings of these game dynamics are highly relevant to problems that are familiar to the military intelligence community, such as knowing how to parameterize plans and when to execute them. Partial observability of environments compounds these difficulties by adding a degree of uncertainty to the mix.  However, a question that remains to be answered is how well recent accomplishments in gaming agents, can improve real-world decision-making aids that require situational awareness over high-dimensional observations.  DL approaches are making it possible for machines to learn from experiences, adapt to new data, and provide recommendations on optimal behavior. Insights from these models can be communicated to users and analytics providing an intelligence and command advantage. However, the lack of transparency and explainability have made it impossible for these decision makers to put lives at risk based on a black box opinion on the best path forward.  In addition, current AI and DL solutions focus on individual decisions based on the current situation with minimal concern for longer term strategic impacts.  To solve these two shortcomings, the Machina Cognita Technologies team proposes to develop the State-based Machine Aided Real Time Strategy (SMARTS) engine.  The SMARTS engine will provide the ability to analyze an array of potential sequences of actions (or decision tracks), the risks associated with each of these actions, and the required capabilities and effectiveness for units to execute the actions.  In addition, the SMARTS engine will provide clear explanations as to the reasoning behind the recommended actions, the impact on mission effectivities, and the possible outcomes for the recommended actions and alternative paths.  Specifically, we seek to create a machine learning framework for distilling mission plans into interpretable strategic and tactical decision tracks using a combination of behavioral cloning, unsupervised learning, and attention networks."

R2-D2 provides this reliable, on-demand manufacturing of unmanned systems in two ways. The first is through a fabrication process that leverages additive manufacturing to embed assembly hardware, wiring, flight components, and electronics directly into the chassis parts during manufacture. This design greatly reduces assembly difficulty and time. The second method to provide agile manufacturing is with robotics and automation to enable R2-D2 to run continuously and unmanned to yield functional drones in the shortest amount of time. Logistically, R2-D2 requires that only a standalone, small-footprint, mobile industrial system and raw materials to be shipped to the area of the emergency event. This greatly simplifies deployment in contrast to premade unmanned platform products that are fully built before shipping. These premade products require assembly, proper packaging, and then shipment to the point of need, all adding time and reducing the ability for first responders to adapt to changing conditions. R2-D2 streamlines this process and mitigates the logistical overhead and cost required to ship a premade drone swarm to another location.

Not only the inbound and outbound flow, internal and external goods, services, people, and organizations need to be managed, analyzed and secured, but also information flow needs to be managed, analyzed, and secured. The greatest challenge for DLFRS is that processes are dispersed and stove-piped,  with limited information sharing, require constant monitoring, discovery,  prediction, and simulation that receive data feed from chains of subsystems of maintenance, requisition, transportation, and finance, and minimize the downtime of personnel and equipment. Cascade Clean Energy has been conducting business in the integrated areas of data sciences, environmental engineering, and product development.  In the project, we propose to apply and demonstrate an innovative framework that leverages artificial Intelligence to learn, optimize, and win (LAILOW) for DLFRS  towards a product prototype of a minimum viable product  with the technology readiness level 3 or 4. LAILOW for DLFRS evolves the current and complex logistical support for fragile, remote systems that could be impacted by external events (e.g., health emergency, natural disasters and wartime) into a dynamic/agile, reliable, and robust logistical support system and network for enhancing the remote system’s knowledge-of-self, dynamic data sharing and routing, for current and future logistical needs. The LAILOW framework can be set up as a  multi-segment game played by a self-player and the opponent of a complex enterprise such as DLFRS  which contain three components of learn, optimize and win: Component 1 - Learn: The self-player first learns predictive, association, and sequential patterns from historical data;  Component 2 – Optimize: The self-players optimizes the measures of effectiveness (MOEs) or the measures of performances (MOPs), defined by business decision makers, by searching through all possible courses of actions; and Component 3 – Win: In a real-time and dynamic operational environment, the opponent (either environmental or adversarial) generates new operation conditions and events that might change maintenance, manufacturing, and transportation times, in an intent to disrupt the whole complex system, the self-player tries to predict and optimize the actions and decisions to counter the opponent’s state/actions. The whole processes iterate.  If successful, the resulted product will be an example of a resilient and agile DLFRS to improve readiness and sustainment at peace time or at war of DLFRS in the areas of maintenance, supply, transportation, health services, general engineering, and finance."

In prior work, Mayachitra has successfully applied reinforcement learning and reidentification approaches in maritime vessel detection from cameras in ships which will serve as representative imagery similar to periscope imagery data. Mayachitra has also worked on transfer learning where the last layers of pre-trained black box approaches are analyzed and then transferred to new data.

The proposed approach is based on a surrogate modeling control system developed by Professor Joseph Beaman’s lab at UT, and uses in-situ infrared temperature measurements to create surrogate sintering models that predict optimal laser power with real-time data. The surrogate models are dynamically generated since they use information acquired from each layer to improve their predictive capabilities. Using real-time data to update these models allows the control system to maintain optimal laser power by adapting to the dynamic fabrication environment during the sintering process. However, the surrogate modeling approach requires location-specific information to train the model because the ideal laser conditions are time- and location-specific. Therefore, to improve the surrogate model and increase the uniformity of AM metal parts, we will adapt the feed-forward technique to include an artificial neural network (NN) that will allow the IR measurements acquired in one location to be generalized and applied to other positions while fabrication is underway.

Using a mission driven and decision centered design process, our research and associated innovative experimentation will temporally identify and properly characterize the watch team information needs. This provides the foundation for applying predictive analytics through machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI), significantly increasing a watch team’s ability to handle greater complexity and uncertainty. Utilizing and properly combining the appropriate tactical information, environmental variables, and historical data can also serve to measure and track evolving tactical risks. This information, when compared with risks perceived by the watch team, can lead to alternative considerations otherwise potentially missed. In addition, providing timely tactical cues can and should increase the platform’s safety as well as effectiveness for successfully completing routine and non-routine evolutions. Capturing and incorporating fleet expertise as tactical cues will also serve to provide continuous watch team training."

This approach is insufficient for current Navy/Marine training needs, which increasingly require different platforms and mission capabilities interacting and operating together. Stand-alone systems require instructors to gather data manually to deliver an AAR. They must resort to hand-written notes, chatlogs, and review of trainee work products to connect events and observations across systems. The current process is tedious and slow, does not scale, and results in less effective training. In Phase I, we researched and designed a novel software architecture to deliver more automated and more effective AAR. The Trafalgar architecture exploits and integrates well-structured, consistent data, but also anticipates the inclusion of unstructured documents and semi-structured data. All of this data is required to put exercise events into a coherent, causal context to support evidence-based debrief and AAR principles. Importantly, meaningful integration of heterogenous data requires artificial intelligence (AI) to integrate, process, and personalize AAR. In Phase I, we implemented several feasibility demonstrations using AI to capture meaningful learner and performance data, even from stand-alone systems, and used this captured data in a proof-of-concept AAR Delivery environment that tailors its presentation based on evidence-based principles and the individual performance of individuals and teams. For Phase II, we propose to develop the AAR architecture designed in Phase I and then to instantiate and to test the architecture for a specific application.

AIMS will not be a black box solution. An objective of AIMS is to provide a system that develops trust with operators and provides CBM capabilities.  Our approach will be consistent with the strategy: “The purpose of the CBM strategy is to perform maintenance only when there is an objective evidence of need, while ensuring safety, equipment reliability, equipment availability, and reduction of total ownership cost. The fundamental goal of CBM is to optimize readiness while reducing maintenance and manning requirements.”  Deployment of AIMS capability will allow the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) to implement CBM within the Naval Aviation Maintenance Program (NAMP) in a deliberate and phased manner.  Initially running in parallel with time and operating hour-based inspections, AIMS will provide early detection and characterization of system anomalies and component failures.  As the NAE gains confidence in AIMS performance, aircraft systems not critical to safety of flight could be transitioned from schedule-based maintenance to CBM.  Once proven, AIMS would facilitate transition of all appropriately instrumented aircraft systems to CBM."

(NPD), intends to develop a system, WiseOwl, for processing ADS-B data using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to discover insights into the data being transmitted and apparent aircraft behavior. ML technologies are highly effective at processing large volumes of data with high accuracy and can automate and/or augment processes which currently require a human operator. NPD will develop innovative algorithms to analyze and discover patterns in a stream of ADS-B messages as well as provide advanced validation of the reported flight data using aircraft reference data and other raw data sources to add fidelity to the automated behavior analysis. Specifically, NPD plans to employ Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches which are highly accurate and robust when applied to very large datasets. NPD will develop automated rules-based approaches for analyzing expected aircraft kinematics, clustering algorithms to analyze flight behavior, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning approaches to spoofed message detection, and correlation of ADS-B tracks with other sensor’s track data. Phase II prototype development will focus on extending the main Phase I research objectives: data cleaning, analysis of self-reported flight behavior characteristics, and detection of spoofed message attack in RF. Additionally, Phase II will augment the WiseOwl system with new capability to gain further insights into aircraft intent via ADS-B data by performing multilateration which will leverage the distributed sensor nature of Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), and by using ADS-B data combined with other sources of data for track validation. Phase II development will result in modular, easy to integrate components that are computationally efficient, accurate, and capable of standing alone or deployed as a complete WiseOwl system. The Phase II prototype system is expected to be completed in 18 months with an exit TRL The WiseOwl system will concisely present discoveries, anomalies, and insights from the ADS-B data. For the prototype system, an easy to use web-based visualization tool will be leveraged; however, in a deployed environment such as CEC, NPD engineers will present data and discoveries in whatever format is necessary for the transition platform. WiseOwl will augment human analysis for enhanced real-time situational awareness and intelligence production. The ability to discover and view flight corridors, abnormal flight behavior, and anomalous ADS-B message traffic will equip commanders with the necessary tools to help assess friend or foe and assist in determining aircraft intent in nearby airspace in tools such as Composite ID, part of the CEC platform."

Specifically, we aim to provide behavior characterization (BC) and anomaly detection (AD) aspects of a geographic region’s aviation traffic in a human-understandable format. This Human-Interpretable AI Learning System (HAILS) is encapsulated as a software service so that it can easily be integrated with multiple systems. By defining what is “normal” traffic and bounding those operations by corridors, as well as identifying anomalous behavior, we aim to provide the NAVSEA system operator with better situational awareness of the aviation operations in the area and thereby seek to reduce workload. The findings of our Phase I research indicate that the use of AI/ML technologies to determine the BC and AD of area aircraft operations using publically available trajectory data is feasible and very promising for enhancing NAVSEA operators’ situational awareness in a given geographic region. We successfully demonstrated three key technical aspects: (1) we synthesized and curated aircraft trajectories from ADS-B data so that they are analysis-ready and can be fed into AI/ML algorithms for BC and AD;  (2) we applied AI/ML algorithms in the form of the Multiple Kernel Anomaly Detector (MKAD), originally developed by NASA, to a subset (i.e., approximately 42,500 arrival flights to San Jose International Airport) for training and anomaly detection; and (3) we increased the geographic scope of the trajectory data for AI/ML input to beyond the San Francisco Bay Area by the fusing of multiple sensory inputs. In Phase II, we develop HAILS leveraging our work and findings from Phase I (described above) and further test it on additional traffic scenarios. To accomplish this, we address three primary objectives in Phase II: (1) Extend prototype BC & AD components to additional traffic scenarios and volume. This objective involves processing additional data in terms of historical timeframe and geographic scope for input to the HAILS learning process; (2) Increase the number of features considered by the AI approach when performing BC & AD. In the AI/ML context, these features are an attribute or property of the system being studied (in this case, the air traffic in a region) on which analysis or prediction is to be done. By increasing the number of features, the number of ways that HAILS can characterize behavior and determine anomalies is increased; and (3) Increase the explainability of the system BC & AD output.  This objective addresses the key challenge with AI/ML systems in that often users fail to accept the results of AI/ML models because there is no way to explain the reason for the model output in a human-understandable form."

Machine learning and deep-learning artificial intelligence are used to detect characteristic signatures and trends in sensor data indicative of rapid and gradual sensor degradation from various natural and manmade events. A Sensor Degradation Reasoning System examines a constant stream of external and internal vehicle sensor data, continually assess data characteristics for evidence of potential and actual degradation and, upon detection, recommend and implement alternative courses of action to maintain readiness and achieve mission objectives.

Recent advancements for autonomous control, such as deep reinforcement learning, offer the ability to scale to previously unsolvable problems. However, the ability of the Navy to leverage these advancements is limited because methods do not exist to test and certify that these systems will reliably achieve mission goals. An underlying problem is that autonomous agents might act incorrectly in environment states that are poorly represented in the training/simulation data, and their learned behavior is opaque to human understanding. Therefore, the Navy requires way to certify a system is ‘deployable’ or reliable enough given the amount of testing it has undergone and the competency of its performance observed per task. The Navy C4/ISR community seeks to develop AI-based adaptive network routing algorithms to improve communications and data exchange between submarines, shore facilities, and rest of the fleet. In our proposed Phase II effort, we will develop the testing and certification capability that the C4/ISR community needs to ensure that future AI-based adaptive network routing algorithms are deployable and reliably meet mission goals. Our certification approach for these AI/ML systems consists of (1) ensuring satisfactory performance on a collection of intelligently-selected test scenarios and (2) guaranteeing the coverage of test scenarios is broad enough to confidently predict performance in un-tested scenarios. We propose a novel certification approach of AI/ML techniques for autonomous agent control leveraging dynamically constructed Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). An MDP is a mathematical framework for decision making, that when solved, produces a policy and a value function. The policy describes the best action to take in each state, while the value function is a measure corresponding to the likelihood of achieving the goal from each state. We will use execution traces of the AI/ML system in given test scenarios to construct an MDP, then use the resulting policy and value function to (1) evaluate the degree of optimality of the agent’s performance in the given test scenarios and (2) identify gaps in the test scenario’s coverage of agent behavior followed by recommendations for new test scenarios. The use of MDPs in the certification process is significant because it provides a baseline from which to measure the performance of the AI/ML algorithm being tested with a rigorous mathematical basis from which to grade optimality. Due to our innovative use of MDPs, we refer to the certification capability to be developed in Phase II as the AI-based MDP Uncertainty Reduction tool, or AIMUR Certification Tool."

Automated pattern and anomaly recognition remains a daunting problem for USV/UUV missions. The objective of this program is to provide an automated system that will allow UUVs the ability to detect and avoid mines and other hazardous objects, with accuracy comparable to a modern manned surface or submersible craft. This problem encompasses all of the issues associated with auditability, opacity, and “big data” including storage, search, and filtering. Artificial intelligence and deep learning systems used for image analysis and pattern recognition have a significant limitation: there is no way to explain how their decisions are made. Conventional edge detection techniques result in too many false positives; this is because they are not cognizant of shape and have no awareness of the photometric characteristics of physical objects texture characterization or topographical features. No current commercial technologies exist that address the military applications that the Navy seeks. Vy has developed a powerful set of algorithms called Shape Based Modeling Segmentation (SBMS). We apply transparent and auditable mathematical models (Bézier curves and decision trees) to collect hard data from visual imagery that significantly increases the speed and accuracy of object recognition. In Phase I of this Project, we successfully demonstrated that Vy’s novel SBMS technology can be applied to detect mines and subsurface obstacles in an automated way that is compatible with Navy standards such as COIN (Common Operator Interface) and UMAA (Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture). Our shape detection technology is well suited to the challenges of object detection and collision avoidance under harsh conditions where many sources of noise and distortion are present. An important benefit of Vy’s SBMS technology is that it provides a data representation architecture that fuses data from multiple sources (hyperspectral, multi-sensor and multi-mode) into an integrated format, assigning a numerical characterization of the credibility of each signal based on the degree to which that signal is corroborated by other sensor responses. All results of SBMS are saved in an industry standard database that is auditable and transparent. These capabilities have important implications for improving the reliability of decisions made by the UMAA autonomy stack in a UUV or USV."

HF skywave propagation through ionosphere diffraction is a challenging communication channel that exhibits both low and short terms temporal fluctuations and is susceptible to unintentional interference due to spectral congestion, and intentional and adversarial jamming. To mitigate interference, a frequency agile approach will be used to suppress jammers. If the HF communication link is also under broadband barrage jamming attack, then wide dynamic range analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and machine learning will also be used. RF front-end and software defined radio technologies will harden our HF radio so that it can withstand and survive interference and jamming attacks without causing service interruptions or damage. Our implementation includes: gallium nitride low-noise amplifiers offering front-end high-linearity and high-power-handling capability; precise high-resolution and high-linearity ADCs offering high dynamic range and high waveform fidelity; digital-signal-processing and mixed signal techniques employing machine learning and artificial intelligence for signal filtering with extremely low signal-to-noise ratio."

Threats can exist at various elevations, ranges, and headings and can use civilian crowds to mask their movements and intentions. Maintaining situational awareness in these conditions can be overwhelming. To autonomously attend to all the potential threats within an environment, we propose the Panoptic Guardian-VTA (Video Threat Analysis) processing system. Panoptic Guardian-VT employs a modular processing architecture and hierarchical inference scheme to achieve real-time detection, classification, and tracking of military targets. It will operate in complex, cluttered environments with moving people and vehicles, both day and night. In contrast to existing systems, Panoptic Guardian-VTA identifies objects that not only look like but also move and behave like threats by utilizing state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Deep learning approaches to object and activity recognition are continuously pushing the state of the art. The computer vision community has driven this success by amassing huge, diverse, labeled video datasets by scouring the Internet and video sharing websites. However, this organic approach to data diversity is hard to replicate in the niche domain of target and threat detection from infrared video. Planned data collections are invariably limited to the diversity of the background environment and the total number of unique entities represented. Therefore, training robust detectors in this domain hinges on the development of intelligent data-collection techniques and data-augmentation algorithms to artificially recreate the diversity in the labeled IR video datasets that deep-learning requires. Panoptic Guardian-VTA will create threat detectors in infrared imagery by (1) developing efficient, semi-automated image annotation methods, (2) using image compositing to increase the variety while decreasing the cost of training data collection, and (3) developing advanced deep neural networks architectures based on state-of-the-art methods. Our automated image annotation will use co-boresighted, calibrated RGB and IR cameras.  Modern RGB detectors, trained on large open datasets, will be used to bootstrap IR training data generation, reducing annotation labor costs. Green-screen-like compositing will extract actors from controlled IR videos and place them in scenes in realistic poses based on 3D and semantic knowledge extracted from the scenes. Our advanced architectures will use a multi-stage approach, similar to region proposal networks, to find people, and then in those locations look for weapons and analyze motion. We will combine our various threat cues into a single threat level score that can alert warfighters to danger, reducing mental load and increasing blue force safety and lethality."

To perform accurate threat assessment an automated system must be able to identify enemy capability, infer intent and predict the overall threat posed by persons and objects in proximity of the camera. These characteristics are typically not directly measurable and are often expressed in subtle observable cues. Our approach estimates threat level for detected targets using a multi-cue machine learning based approach. The proposed method extracts features from electro-optical and infrared imagery to identify personnel, weaponry and other objects in view of the camera. Several machine learning based detection, recognition, identification and context estimation modules contribute features which are fused and aggregated over time to describe long-term trends. These aggregated threat profiles are then classified to identify anomalies. Ultimately, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to monitoring threats in the battlefield and near civil infrastructure will improve the speed and probability of threat mitigation and increase safety for warfighters and civilians alike."

The requirement to produce timely and accurate decisions in uncertain dynamic environments necessitates artificially intelligent agents that can be used to enhance the speed and accuracy of human decision makers; automate the generation, evaluation, and execution of mission plans; and improve effectiveness and reduce staffing needs of virtual environments used for training and mission rehearsals. Current artificial intelligence (AI) agents lack cognitive skills, including exhibiting human-like curiosity, biases, and errors; learning complex tasks quickly with limited feedback; coordinating with human or AI “teammates;” and are unable to continue functioning well during scenarios/operations that span long time horizons. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have allowed a wide range of these complex decision-making tasks to be solved, reaching performance levels comparable to or surpassing that of human experts. However, many state-of-the-art DRL methods have technical limitations restricting their use in real-world applications, including high sample complexity, lack of meta-reasoning, limited coordination awareness, and narrow counterfactual reasoning. Aptima and Cubic Corp. propose to develop ENDGAME (Exploring Neuroscientifically Derived Gameplaying Agents for MMO Environments): a framework for and implementation of adaptive, intelligent, cooperative agents. The ENDGAME solution is based on our adaptation of the active inference theory, called Deep Active Inference. Our Deep Active Inference framework provides the objective functions and scalable computational mechanisms that enable ENDGAME agents to execute four processes fundamental to human cognition: learning, perception, planning, and simulation. Further, it provides tractable Bayesian computations to learn causal environment representations and agent behavior models, estimate hidden states of the world, and construct long-term plans using forward (generative) models to simulate alternative counterfactual versions of the past and future. Because active inference allows for the evaluation of internal uncertainty, our agents will be able to seek novel experiences, learn about and interact with their teammates, and combine prior knowledge with reasoning even with sparse feedback. Several recent computational studies showed that active inference achieves superior performance in uncertain dynamic environments compared to standard and deep reinforcement learning baselines, attaining higher utility earlier in the learning process and adapting faster to changing environments. By leveraging active inference, ENDGAME agents will offer more natural human-like behaviors, increased planning depth and decision robustness, optimized learning and coordination, and a faster development and validation cycle."

As the use of SAR in the Army on manned and unmanned airborne platforms continues to grow, there is a critical need to automate the analysis of SAR imagery. Currently, human analysts are overwhelmed by the massive amounts of SAR imagery collected every day. To compound the problem, SAR imagery is harder to analyze than EO/IR imagery because the images are more susceptible to the location of scattering centers, multipath scattering, and occlusions. DeepSAR will leverage proven software to autonomously extract timely actionable information from SAR imagery. Unlike other modalities, SAR can capture images during the day and night and in all weather conditions. In addition, SAR allows detection through dense foliage, forested areas, wooded terrain, camouflage, and has applicability in multiple areas of operation. In the short term, DeepSAR will reside in a ground station; however, in the future it can be integrated directly on the airborne platform, thereby radically mitigating downlink requirements."

These methods are computationally expensive and are not able to operate in real-time or with many object interactions within the framework of the video. However, recent research by The Ohio State University has developed a methodology for extracting and analyzing video frameworks in a real-time highly accurate manner. In this paper, Ubihere is proposing building upon that research to create a commercial implementation of this artificial intelligence research to develop a high impact solution for relevant Air Force operations. There are a very large number of existing functions/operations/actions within the DoD which would benefit from a highly capable easy-to-train visual based artificial intelligence platform.

USVs will be tasked with a variety of missions from collections to mine clearance, and every situation within every mission demands autonomous, dynamic, real-time onboard SIGCON. This includes the ability to follow International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs)/Rules of the Road and Emissions Control (EMCON) as appropriate. We propose SIGMA (SIGnature Management Agent) to autonomously control signatures on USVs. SIGMA takes in potentially days-old broad guidance from a distant controlling station (e.g., mission objectives, commander’s intent, ROE, etc.) as well as organic and inorganic data (e.g., radar, sonar, AIS, GPS, weather) to appropriately control sensors (e.g., turn off active radar, turn ship, broadcast AIS) and employ techniques (e.g., utilize deceptive lighting, spray mist or chaff). SIGMA utilizes several tried-and-tested artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including Knowledge Engineering (KE), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Behavior Transition Networks (BTNs), and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). Knowledge Engineering refers to the process of extracting knowledge from subject matter experts, developing a Knowledge Representation (KR), and building a system based on formal and informal facts, rules, and frames. Robert Bergman and Jonathan Vandervelde, who have expert knowledge in Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) and Electronic Warfare (EW), will provide subject matter expertise that will be integrated into SIGMA. Fuzzy Logic captures rules that reference qualitative, inexact, or “fuzzy” values such High/Medium/Low. Behavior Transition Networks create intelligent behaviors by dividing behavior hierarchically into tasks connected by transitions. Finally, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) attempts to solve the current problem by retrieving a previously encountered similar problem and adapting that problem’s solution to the current situation. In Phase I, we will develop a limited prototype SIGMA and test it using both the Navy-provided data and our in-house simulator. In Phase II, we will build at least two SIGMAs with improved capabilities that meet the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA), and we will integrate them into actual USVs."

The 9-HI collaboration platform was developed by American Ingenuity Consulting (AIC) to allow government procurement and SMEs from government, industry and academia to work with a common tool set to accelerate technology development by measuring strengths and weaknesses and then removing risks from the development and procurement process. 9-HI-based machine learning and artificial intelligence allows us to treat historical and real-time data as an organized set of evidence for optimized recommendations to drive successful product innovation outcomes. 9-HI improves the selection and development decision processes. Our process starts with capturing DoD user input on existing technologies and product assets. Numerous measurement factors recommended by SMEs, users and later AI are rolled up into a standardized 9-point scoring system that employs algorithms to optimize target outputs and clearly identify risks as gaps, barriers or vulnerabilities. Comparisons between competing technologies inform procurement and SMEs regarding selection of the best technologies and development and procurement options to accelerate implementations from years to months. 9-HI is applied to every step of selection and development. After each use, 9-HI saves all data in a novel storage regime that allows for simplified recall for other related applications.  9-HI is based on a novel AI approach that uses Higher Order Logic (HOL) to guide reinforced Machine Learning. Because the 9-HI HOL is in the form of a mathematical power set, it is able to represent ( capture and compare all options within the art of the possible. Thus, any development option can be scored and compared to aid in the decision process.   Our Phase II and III committed customer is JPEO Ammunition & Armament. They will have a direct Air Force benefit as they have significant Air Force personnel within their organization and flow A&A benefits from their technology development activities directly to Air Force A&A applications. The secondary yet powerful benefit is that they also have team members form the US Army US Navy and US Marine Corps on their collaborative leadership teams that can be tapped to help grow the trans-service applications of 9-HI. This is a significant portion of our development and growth plans for this platform."

The USAF depends on computers and networks for the Command and Control (C2) of mission critical systems. QSMS provides several features designed to harden this infrastructure against the emerging threat of quantum computing hacking. We use Post-Quantum and Classical Cryptographic KMS (CKMS), designed to manage and protect keys on behalf of a variety of applications including database Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) clients, as well as Data Security Platform solutions. QSMS uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a secure communication method that implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. An important and unique property of quantum key distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. QuSecure’s QSMS is capable of providing the USAF with a Distributed Architecture on Post-Quantum Blockchain for Consensus Based on Non-Repudiation Assurance. QSMS is deployable on appliances, virtual appliances, and in the Cloud (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). QSMS includes Kubernetes Containerized Platform for Zero-Trust Key Management for Post-Quantum Algorithm and Signature Serving, is backwards compatible, with current applications being used on USAF networks. QSMS provides significant, quantitative benefits to the AF, such as Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Attack Detection Logic leveraging Quantum Entanglement Sensing; Deep Learning AI Driven Attack Micro-Segmentation Logic leveraging QKD and Quantum Entanglement-Based Sensing; QKD Device Management, using Management of Key Generation Frequency, Key Distribution and Exchange, Attack Sensing; Network Switch and Router Management through an Application Programming Interface (API) connection to switch infrastructure; and RESTful API for Integration with Current Infrastructure (SysLog, Classical Key Management System (KMS), Hardware and Infrastructure Management). QSMS uses Quantum Resilient Distributed Architecture based on Blockchain. Additionally, we employ the use of Deep Learning AI. Various forms of multifactor authentication are implemented to protect users’ wallets including facial recognition and other forms of biometrics. Lastly, a QSMS communication protocol is created which establishes secure communication between wallets and the blockchain. This protocol is designed to guard against interception style of attacks similar but not limited to “man-in-the-middle, session hijack and replay”. The goal of the QSMS communication protocol is to subdivide packets as they are encoded and transmitted into various “data bits” and are transmitted over differing communication channels to reduce the likelihood of interception and reassembly. The different channels of communication are encoded using varying algorithms from the NIST Approved list and recompiled at the blockchain level."

DoD 5000.02 also categorizes the specific mandatory reports (statutory and regulatory) and other information necessary for program milestones and decision points. The instruction is published by the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Acquisition and Logistics (A&L). The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process defines acquisition requirements and evaluation criteria for future defense programs. JCIDS was created to replace previous service-specific requirements generation systems that created redundancies in capabilities and failed to meet the joint needs of all the services. The Air Force acquisition system is led by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics (AT&L), which follow the USAF Acquisition Process Model (APM), Published Version 10.1 dated November 18, 2019. In addition to the DoD and USAF acquisition model, there are a multitude of other Federal Government procurement organizations, such as the General Services Administration (GSA) with countless contracting vehicles, Government wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, etc. The net result is an overly complicated system that taxes the resources of prospective industry contract performers and is an even deeper burden to the small business community who might not have the infrastructure, skillsets, or expertise to be successful within the government acquisition process. The fragmented, decentralized procurement systems have separate funding streams that are disconnected, certiﬁcations that are cumbersome and confusing for people to navigate, and a countless number of small businesses are left wanting. Inefficiencies within the sourcing process also limits the number and quality of the bids, resulting in: A mountain of paperwork. Having to research supplier information. Slow procurement processes and bottlenecks that take a long time to get through. Waiting for compliance reports. Manual information collection. Complaints from the small business community who are left out. Issues with NAICS numbering system. Because the landscape is so overwhelmingly difficult, it is hard for everyone to navigate (buyers, procurement staff and suppliers alike). To address these issues, Avisare has developed a Software-as-a-Service platform for the contracting and small business ecosystem. This Technology Readiness Level (TRL) -8 system is designed for easy off-the-shelf use. It allows a network of suppliers to communicate and collaborate.

Lillian employs a Predictive Hiring Intelligence Algorithm that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to evaluate a pilot candidate's education, training, and experience in parallel with their culture, background, personality traits and behaviors, and motivations. This assessment enables us to provide a recommendation that more accurately assesses the viability of candidates' success and reduces the percentage of wash out during pilot training. Additionally, by implementing Lillian, this produces a reduction in the cost associated with training and re-training pilots by aligning the most qualified candidates with pilot programs from the start. Lillian is a platform that is integrated with a proprietary algorithm to match Airmen to e.g., the F-35 program, based on the Airmen's profile including test scores, personal interests, career plans, motivation, etc. This not only evaluates an Airmen to determine a fit with the F-35 program but also assess their ability to succeed. While Lillian assesses an Airmen's viability as a pilot candidate, it can also be used to evaluate and assess other Airmen with a career in the Air Force that aligns with their own personal and career goals and enable them to succeed in the Air Force. Additionally, Lillian can be used to assess the continual motivation of Airmen and potential uses that may arise affecting their motivation. "

No solution has been implemented to digitize and diagnose “soft tissue” problems that include the MSIs in the study involving USAF Special Operators. Our company, FIGUR8, now makes it feasible to do so – and to do so quickly and inexpensively. The FIGUR8 team has built the FIGUR8 Fusion System, a highly accurate, scalable and wearable hardware and supporting based software to measure, score and apply artificial intelligence (AI) analytics to make MSK health information available for everyone at 90% less cost and can be done in 95% less time. The applications of the FIGUR8 FUSION System range from quick screening of body injury risks to a diagnostic companion and rehabilitation feedback for patients. A FIGUR8 Body Assessment report provides clinicians with data to better inform clinical decision making, and injury risk screening. Movement metrics culminated from muscle activation, joint angles, body segment position and tasks are captured and analyzed during a set of specific activities to generate an individual’s movement analysis or Kinematic Blueprint. Based on these inputs, the intelligent platform identifies and flags potential deficits and strengths. This process can speed up the evaluation process for a clinician (i.e.: physical therapist, athletic trainer, physician) and expedite prescribing a treatment approach, pre employment baseline screening, injury assessment for insurance claims and readiness for return to sport after injury. FIGUR8 is the most advanced digital solution for evaluating musculoskeletal health. It is the only diagnostics platform that captures three-dimensional skeletal movement in conjunction with muscle output to help trainers, therapists and physicians objectively measure musculoskeletal performance and recovery. Developed through partnerships with the MIT Media Lab and Massachusetts General Hospital’s Sports Science Lab, FIGUR8’s Movement Assessment Platform is the most accurate portable on-body assessment system, leveraging years of research in athletic performance optimization using the latest advancements in wearable sensors."

Had they collided, the debris field from that event would have endangered potentially hundreds of other space assets also circling the globe. Even small pieces of debris can cause catastrophic damage to high-value satellites, many of which are critical operational devices on which our nation depends each day.  The warfighters responsible for managing satellite command and control face a huge challenge in their task load each day, building awareness of potential events like this by gathering as much available data as possible, from sources as diverse as ground sensors, social media feeds, amateur astronomer observations, published observations from private firms, data made available by observers in other countries, as well as data collected by the USAF. The main problem with the current command and control situation is that data comes in too slowly, and in such a high volume, that it is impossible for a human operator to make sense of it fast enough to react in time to prevent catastrophe. Most of the time, operators can only deal with assets over which they have direct control, and if a threat assessment is made only moments before a potential collision, there is little an operator can do at that point to mitigate the threat to assets worth literally billions of dollars. Vigilant proposes to adapt our ""Layer-8"" Intelligent Workspace solution, leveraging it's AI and Machine Learning capabilities to address the need for improved satellite command and control functions in a hybrid architecture. The goal is to support and improve the current satellite command and control structure, developing adaptations that provide autonomous threat detection and assessment, course-of-action responses, case-based reasoning for alerting, real-time data fusion, and microservices developed in support of simulations. The adaptation would also address the objective of machine-to-machine notifications and tactical/operational replanning, developing the ability of satellites to ""talk"" to each other through the system, making satellites ""smarter"" about their environment and decreasing the time it takes for appropriate actions to be taken by operators when threats are present.  This adaptation of the Vigilant Intelligent Workspace meets Air Force objectives laid out in Focus Area 23: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Dual Use Technologies by addressing the specific objectives in Focus Area 22.2: Ubiquitous Satellite Command, Control, and Operations, which is a perfect fit for our technology. There are many other potential customers distributed throughout the Air Force, and other areas of the DoD, that would potentially benefit from this solution; discovering those customers would also be a primary goal of this effort. "

Managing the amount and technical complexity of data is a challenge for even trained and experienced crews. In addition, large numbers of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), and associated sensors, are being rapidly developed and deployed, further increasing the amount of data that needs exploited. Skyward proposes to develop a novel capability to determine, assess, categorize, and counter ground threats via anomaly detection which will reduce data processing times and increase analytical focus.  The Anomaly Detection Onboard Identification System (ADONIS) will implement uniquely developed algorithms and miniaturized hardware to quickly and autonomously process real-time sensor data onboard UAS platforms. Processed data will result in tips and cues to be disseminated from aircraft to the ground. These tips and cues will indicate the presence of potential anomalies within large volumes of data, so analysts can focus on the most actionable information first.  Our solution builds on several proven commercial technologies and is adaptable to most DoD and commercial sUAS-based sensors (e.g., LIDAR, SAR, EO/IR, Hyperspectral).  Artificial Intelligence (AI) or statistical averaging algorithms will be developed and demonstrated using existing government/commercial software and deployed to lightweight, commercial AI acceleration hardware for use on sUAS platforms.  ADONIS will demonstrate the capability to more rapidly and efficiently assess threats, thereby increasing resiliency and security for Future Bases, Installations and Airmen, and substantially reducing O&M costs."

Composite structures are required to undergo these ultrasonic inspections at the end of the manufacturing process, and the interpretation of the large data sets is a manual process. The ADA can use a selection of technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) to assist inspectors, with massive reductions in the data that must be reviewed by humans (over 90% reduction in trials on F-35 production parts). This reduces labor hours and flow time while improving reliability by providing consistent, algorithmic methods to the interpretation of large data sets.  "

The promise of “decision advantage” from satellite imagery has given way to data overload with much of it left unexploited, put into archive. With as much imagery being collected and so little exploited, it is difficult to measure the lost opportunity. Artificial intelligence (AI), however, offers a remedy to make full use of this data. For this project, CrowdAI proposes ACME, the AI-assisted Contingency Monitoring Enterprise, which automates imagery exploitation using deep learning and computer vision. At CrowdAI, we have devised and built novel approaches to deep-learning, producing some of the highest performing computer vision (CV) algorithms on the market today. Our algorithms exploit cutting-edge techniques in image segmentation (Graphic 1 - center), using proprietary convolutional neural networks (CNN). CrowdAI segmentation models achieve superior results by incorporating, and iteratively improving upon, lower-quality training data in tight feedback loops. Thus, CrowdAI can exploit a significantly lower quantity of annotated images for a given performance requirement. Said differently, not only is the annotation process completed using fewer resources, by it has the potential to unlock deep-learning applications for rare objects and features for which abundant training data is difficult or impossible to obtain. To maximize flexibility, CrowdAI’s general models have been trained on data from multiple sensor platforms (commercial satellite, government airborne, government FMV, etc.) collected at different geometries over more than 125 countries of various geographies, biomes, and seasons. As a result, these “universal” models can be used in new locations with little-to-no retraining. Nevertheless, we continuously fine-tune or re-train models to meet customer requirements. Computer vision offers the means to exploit vast quantities of imagery data with speed and accuracy, twenty-four hours a day. In addition to reducing analytic burden during daily operations, CV models can run in the background against contingency targets, ensuring that facility baselines and their orders of battle (OB) are maintained. With little-to-no human intervention, CV models can detect, classify, and maintain counts of any object for which there is sufficient training data, including military vehicles, weapons platforms, vessels, facilities, and more. Model output can be converted from our “pixel perfect” polygons for each object to centroids or text to automatically populate NGA or DOD databases, such as Cedallion or MARS (MIDB). CV increases the speed and scale of GEOINT analysis. For the Analysis Directorate, CV is the difference between near-real-time automation versus spending untold hours conducting search through petabytes of imagery to maintain OB counts, to find deployed equipment, or monitor targets of national security interest to the US and our allies."

The vehicles and infrastructure used to transport and mobilize vital provisions, and for troops to be mobilized to and from the battlefield, must be frequently maintained to facilitate reliable and cost-efficient mobilization efforts. The USAF utilizes several types of ground vehicles for special operations and to deploy provisions and personnel, including supply chain vehicles and combat vehicles, and are seeking new and innovative technologies to automate vehicle maintenance and service processes (""Automated Fleet Management""), and to increase the efficiency of mobility by reducing the time and cost of repairs and upkeep.  Robotire Inc. has developed a standalone Robotic Container which utilizes Computer Vision Cameras (CS), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to identify a vehicle and perform a fully automated tire change in a swift and precise manner. Robotire's automated process ensures precision and vastly reduces the total time needed to replace 4 tires to approximately 10 minutes. The automated container systems, equipped with vehicle monitoring and diagnosis features, allow for better control and tracking of a vehicles condition and the state of wear-and-tear of the tires, providing additional information regarding the way the driver is using the vehicle and the overall maintenance condition of the vehicle. Each Robotic Container is an independent unit, such that they can be deployed separately, or can be combined into larger units depending on the volume of traffic or parts needed for a specific location. Moreover, the container units can be self-sufficiently powered by solar panels, allowing them to be remotely deployed without additional infrastructure and energy requirements. The Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) facilitates the logistics behind AF mobilization. At the core of this effort are Automated Fleet Management initiatives, to ensure timely responsiveness and operational readiness of supply chain vehicles. Similarly, the Special Operations Command (AFSOC), which deploys troops and equipment (including multi-purpose combat vehicles) in operational territories, is a prime candidate for implementing the Robotire solution for remote operations. During this Phase I project, Robotire's objectives will include contacting the relevant AF stakeholders, evaluating the technical feasibility of reaching their objectives, determining the most appropriate pilot project and partnering with a team to design a technically achievable pilot plan. This Phase I will directly inform the design and implementation of a prototype system during Phase II with the identified Air Force partner.  "

We fuse vast quantities of diverse space data from diverse sources including environmental, positional, and systems health and status, and analyze at the space ecosystem level to derive meaningful incites and predictions for decision making. This will help enable space operators and decision makers to close knowledge gaps, characterize space system activities, understand space environmental impacts to operations, predict future impacts to space services, and then rapidly make informed decisions. Our research addresses two current Air Force R&D focus areas – Focus Area 3 - exploration of AI, Machine Learning, and data science tools for situational awareness and decision making, and focus area 23 - AI and Machine Learning dual use technologies for Air Force Application. The problem addressed is that large volumes of space data from diverse sources is not being analyzed or utilized, and may never reach space-system operators, decision makers, and service customers who would benefit, in a meaningful way.  This routinely creates significant knowledge gaps in Space Domain Awareness (SDA) from satellite positioning and health relative to the larger ecosystem, to an understanding of all ecosystem effects, to threat monitoring. The combination of having too much data to analyze, a lack of understanding and characterization of our space systems within the context of a larger dynamic environment, and the fragmented nature of our networks, has set the conditions for a need to approach the protection of our space assets and understanding of the space environment in a new AI enabled way. We apply automated data fusion techniques to aggregate data from diverse sources. Then we apply Process Mining to map complex space ecosystems and generate pattern of life understanding.

Jaxon continuously incorporates state-of-the-art technologies from the machine learning community, including deep learning architectures, classical algorithms, and the inclusion and ensembling of any custom logic already available (a means of capturing specific information from human subject matter experts). Successful machine learning is an iterative process of finding the right mixture of feature extraction, algorithmic selection, and parameterization to fit a specific combination of data and problem. With Jaxon, customers reap the benefits of:  Speed: substantially faster time-to-label Discoverability: exposing knowledge previously untapped Cost Effectiveness: dramatically reduce manpower needed to build and maintain Robustness to Domain Shift: keeping up with an ever-changing taxonomy (data evolves) Jaxon is on a mission to eliminate the need to have humans manually label data for AI training and make neural architecture, data prep, and pipeline design a snap. This “easy button” ensures that AI projects get put into production in weeks rather than months or years. Working with the defense end-user, the first steps will be to rigorously define a problem specification and determine exactly what level of accuracy is necessary for each task that requires Jaxon. This level will then be used as the benchmark in order to assess final performance. Jaxon will estimate classifier performance using metrics such as an F1 score and a per-class confusion matrix and demonstrate its effectiveness within the Air Force using Air Force data. The Air Force is implementing an advanced Artificial Intelligence strategy that will allow for faster and more accurate decision-making in many areas. Jaxon is able to accelerate the machine learning model creation process in a variety of areas, adapting to each user’s specific problem, data, and accuracy needs. Based on Jaxon’s specialization in unstructured text, a particular pain point within AI, it is a powerful tool for any department interested in intelligence or using text of any kind to inform decision making. Jaxon’s integration into ACE would allow airmen to create fully-trained, reusable models with minimal data labeling from anywhere with just a few clicks, expanding the Air Force’s machine learning initiative exponentially."

Green Revolution Cooling (GRC) is leading the scientific innovation driving the next wave of data cooling solutions suitable for AI.  GRC’s objective is to create data cooling solutions that are robust, conserve valuable space and are extremely power efficient.  GRC’s R&D focuses on the design and scale-up of novel data cooling solutions, for industry and government partners, adhering to specific and challenging operational requirements.  Their innovation lies in their expert command of Liquid Immersion Cooling, where data servers are immersed in a cooling rack filled with a proprietary, nontoxic, non-conductive coolant called ElectroSafe™, which provides 1200X the heat capacity of air.  Heat from the servers is absorbed by the coolant and quickly removed from the rack. The result is a supremely energy-efficient data center cooling system with a cooling capacity up to 100 kW/rack.  An average target for traditional data centers is only 7 kW per rack, whereas it is not unheard of for an AI application to use upwards of 30 kW per rack.   Therefore, GRC’s immersion cooling solutions are suitable for today’s AI needs, and are prepared to handle exponentially more data as progress inevitably continues.  By switching away from legacy data cooling systems to utilizing GRC’s liquid immersion cooling solutions, a data center can expect to see up to 90% reduction of cooling energy consumption. During this Phase I project, GRC objectives will include: Contacting the Air Force Chief Data Office in order to gather use cases, process information, and align with the needs and goals of current Chief Data Office development projects. Evaluate the technical feasibility of reaching the objectives set forth by this team and the needs of the USAF, by performing tasks and integrating GRC technology R&D with existing USAF technologies. Determine the most appropriate pilot project. Partner with a team to design a technically achievable pilot plan that incorporates GRC technology and satisfies both the Air Force Chief Data Office requirements and requirements specified by other stakeholders in the USAF."

MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.

Over $160 billion is spent on sewer fees in the U.S., with year-to-year costs increasing by over 5% for many users. Even with the significant resources spent on wastewater treatment, 3 to 10 billion gallons of untreated sewage are still released from US wastewater treatment plants each year. Development of technologies leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to better manage complex biological and chemical processes will not only have a major impact on the $91 billion wastewater treatment system control market, but on other biochemical-dependent industries as well. In addition to reducing the societal financial burden associated with wastewater treatment, this technology will improve the sustainability of the infrastructure and will limit the environmental impact of human activities. Wastewater operators will be able to utilize this technology's real-time decision-making software to significantly reduce their municipal facility operating costs and decrease environmental pollution caused by non-compliance and overflows. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop real-time software for assisting wastewater treatment operators with decision-making for improved efficiency and effectiveness. Existing commercial simulation solutions for control and monitoring do not accurately reflect actual treatment plant behavior, do not model biological processes, do not require extensive configuration to be used, and do not respond rapidly to changes in plant performance. This project improves upon current approaches by linking biological components of the wastewater treatment plant with historical data using machine learning techniques. Phase I research will focus on development of: 1) an influent flow/composition model allowing accurate model inputs; 2) a full-scale hybrid model combining physical process and machine-learning bioprocess modules able to accurately predict plant effluent flow and quality, and; 3) a software platform to manage the model processes. The technical approach will focus on balancing the complexity of incorporating large-scale genomic data as part of a non-linear treatment process while ensuring high accuracy and maintaining model stability. Anticipated technical results will provide waste operators a software product that develops full-scale treatment plant models in real-time, using historical and current plant data, enabling significantly improved operational decision-making.

The explosion of online learning experiences in recent years, in which many courses fail to engage learners or help them achieve their academic and professional goals, has put focus on the problem of engagement. Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together. This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online. While many students use online collaboration tools such as discussion boards, chat, and video, this project focuses on providing interventions to change behavior in real-time. During conversations, such as those happening when people brainstorm to solve a problem or work on shared assignments, certain vocal patterns indicate engagement, reveal unstated agreements and discords, and expose individual biases. Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows. Together, these innovations combine data that has never been collected at scale before with social science data models uniquely applied to online learning. The goal of the research project is to prove that insights like these have a net positive effect on learning outcomes and raise the level of satisfaction with online learning experiences that incorporate these tools.

The artificially-intelligent algorithm designed in this project will enable domestic scrap processors to become more competitive within the material supply chain by giving them the ability to adapt, in real-time, to an ever-changing material consumption climate. With unstable international commodity trade, US scrap processors must reduce reliance on exporting low-value scrap to maintain profitable business models. Additionally, US scrap must exercise optimal processing schedules to prevent scrap surplus domestically while providing consumers with recycled products that are functionally equivalent to new products. The latter offers an environmentally-friendly scrap-to-product option that reduces the energy required for production and the amount of harmful CO2 released. Aluminum scrap recycling has been practiced for decades; however, the majority of post-consumer scrap is downcycled leaving revenue and environmental benefits untapped. Non-ferrous auto-shred was, on average, sold for $0.33/lb. less than its actual value in 2017, which equates to nearly $1 billion in opportunity cost. Artificially intelligent sorting systems will enable scrap processors to reach higher profit margins and meet environmental goals. The proposed project will completely automate scrap sortation. The advent of multi-sort capability encourages the need for preliminary research to identify how to operate sensor-based sorters optimally. Artificial intelligence can meet this need. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an artificially-intelligent algorithm that is capable of optimizing scrap sortation in real-time. The research objectives include: (1) identify all data sources in the scrap recycling process that  can  influence intelligent decision making (2) design a database to host identified data sources such as compositional, market, inventory, and sales data and (3) design a customized artificially-intelligent algorithm for the  scrap  recycling industry to develop sorting criteria in real-time. To meet these objectives, a dynamic material flow model will be designed to analyze and host all relevant sensor, market, and experimental data streams to minimize data pre-processing requirements. Concurrently, aluminum scrap will be characterized to investigate how frequently and to what degree composition fluctuates. The database that hosts all supportive data streams will be designed to store and integrate all relevant data streams seamlessly. Finally, using an 80/20 training/testing data split with 5-fold cross-validation, the machine learning algorithm will be selected and optimized to provide the lowest error rate for suggested sorting criteria.

The lack of independence directly leads to disadvantages in getting education and joining the workforce. This project, NavigAid, is aimed at creating a breakthrough spatial intelligence aid offered as a mobile application which will solve spatial tasks from locating objects to identifying paths of navigation, and to generating rich descriptions of the surroundings. Solving this problem will unlock an estimated direct economic benefit of $26B annually for people with visual impairment around the world, by decreasing the need for human assistance. The main technological innovation of this project, Ally Networks, is a novel neural network architecture that can learn more robust representations than existing models are able to. The robust representations prevent the networks from making mistakes and make them more operable and useful in situations that need high reliability. Ally Networks thus represent a potential breakthrough to the field of computer-vision navigation. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will introduce a novel spatial intelligence system, NavigAid, to assist individuals with visual impairment in crucial navigation tasks. NavigAid will generate contextually relevant, task-oriented spatial information from smartphone cameras. With NavigAid, users will be able to navigate independently in unfamiliar, complex environments, thus achieving unprecedented mobility. NavigAid will advance assistive technologies by providing unprecedented services, such as locating objects and generating functionally relevant natural language descriptions of complex environments.

These provide the artificial intelligence needed to detect, with high accuracy (low false positive and false negative rates), and mitigate both known and new cyberattacks in high-performance computing systems and hosts. The new tool allows for continuous monitoring of network traffic and/or hosts in high-performance computing clusters and detection, classification, and mitigation of attacks in real time. Cybersecurity information collected by cybersecurity sensors is processed by an analyzer using advanced deep machine learning and prediction algorithms. The analyzer makes intrusion detection decisions, which are passed in the form of alerts to an existing intrusion response mechanism. Large-scale distributed intrusion detection system architecture, framework, and algorithms will be developed to evaluate system performance. Feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by assembling and testing a technology readiness level-4 prototype. The prototype will demonstrate the capability to detect attack patterns and predict attacks in real time in a large-bandwidth (100 Gbps) network. The metrics that determine the prototype’s efficacy and performance will be identified. The proposed technology is expected to have widespread applications in cybersecurity, including secure high-performance computing facilities and enterprise-scale networks, and in computing systems that are used for critical data processing (e.g., in financial and healthcare services).

However, typical high-performance-computing systems and datacenters already consume megawatts of power, and future computing systems must consider energy-efficient, parallel, and accelerated processing that can be commercially deployed. The proposed project pursues energy-efficient, high-performance, and universal accelerator interfaces to sustain the ever-increasing demand for scalable and ubiquitous computing processing power. It is well known that application specific computing systems optimally designed and configured for a given workload offer much higher energy-efficiency and throughput compared to general purpose systems. Heterogeneous computing systems exploiting energy and performance benefits of combining various different domain-specific processor architectures have emerged in modern computing systems of different scales. Application domains like high performance computing and machine learning now process data sets of terabytes in size, requiring increasing numbers of processing and memory resources, at the expenses of very high- power consumption due to bottlenecks in the electrical interconnection between processing units.

Atomically Precise Manufacturing will bring considerable benefit to our technology, economy, and standard of living. However, significant technological development will be required before Atomically Precise Manufacturing can be realized as a reliable and efficient manufacturing process. A promising technology that is being used to develop Atomically Precise Manufacturing is Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) based hydrogen depassivation lithography that can make atomically precise patterns on surfaces. However, hydrogen depassivation lithography is in early stages of transitioning from a microscope technology to a lithography technology. Currently a human expert is required to look at images and make some judgement calls about how to complete the patterning process. To get the human out of the loop so that the patterning process can be automated, faster, and more reliable, Artificial Intelligence guided by physics of the system will be developed to provide the required image analysis capabilities. In Phase I, Zyvex Labs will work with applied Artificial Intelligence experts at Oak Ridge National Lab to develop an AI STM image analysis capability that can identify key features on the Si (100) 2X1 H passivated surfaces. This will allow automated assessment of the lithography process as it is being carried out so that conditions may be optimized even in the face of tip variation and surface defects to create atomically precise patterns. The image analysis will also enable error detection and correction processes to approach patterning perfection. Using these capabilities we will develop sophisticated and adaptable automation processes. If successfully developed, Artificial Intelligence guided hydrogen depassivation lithography will initially make small but extremely valuable products like solid state Analog Quantum Simulation devices to better understand quantum physics and help bring the expected amazing range benefits of quantum materials to the general public, and perhaps a little further down the road the spectacular benefits of quantum computation and communication. Even though massively parallel hydrogen depassivation lithography will be developed, it will still have limited throughput capabilities that can be leveraged by using hydrogen depassivation lithography to make nanoimprint or even roll to roll templates that will dramatically reduce the cost of making extremely accurate patterns at the nanoscale and above. One example application would be Atomically Precise membrane filters which will dramatically reduce manufacturing costs in chemical, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical processing."

Such reduction in fault current supplied by the substation can cause the substation protective-relaying equipment to fail to trip, leaving dangerous faults energized. In response, the U.S. Departmentof Energy is fostering the development of new technologies and tools that will advance protective-relaying capabilities to meet such challenges. By implementing a network of small, electronic devices that operate on the service side of the distribution grid, particular characteristics will be derived and securely-communicated to the substation. At the substation, digital signal processing and artificial intelligence will be used to operate on the information detect and localize faults, identify the protective-relaying equipment to be informed, and inform it, reducing misoperation. In Phase I, design, simulation, implementation, and testing will be conducted to build essential, math-based software. The software elements will enable: 1) extraction of the targeted, grid characteristics; 2) accurate identification of which protective-relaying equipment the information should be used to inform; 3) authentication by an on-grid message that uses a new method to prevent eavesdropping and tampering. A variety of simulations and on-grid tests will be used to verify the performance objectives set for each software element are met and demonstrating the effectiveness of the approaches. The capabilities provided by the system will enable a new generation of advanced, protective-relaying equipment. The technology can also be gracefully retrofitted into existing systems, without the need to interrupt the delivery of energy. Prompt awareness of faults and damage to the power grid are essential to rapidly protecting the public safety, minimizing revenue losses to utilities, and minimizing costs to rate-payers. The information provided by the system can also be used to make operational adjustments to the grid and optimize deployment of repair resources. Other benefits, such as grid-stabilization, can be provided through this technology, by application to the management of distributed energy resources."

Until deep geological disposal sites are identified for very long-term storage of this waste (1000’s of years), interim storage methods must be used for much longer than initially intended (~100 years). With hundreds of dry storage canisters approaching or already exceeding their intended design life, the Department of Energy needs an aging management program to assess the long-term integrity of these canisters. The primary objective of this work is to develop a web-based machine learning software tool for optimizing life-cycle decisions and ensuring long-term performance of welded stainless-steel dry storage canisters for the storage of spent nuclear fuel. Incorporating this tool into daily operations will promote pro-active decision-making and improved risk management to minimize the likelihood of a potentially catastrophic, failure event (loss of the canister’s containment boundary). To ground the outcome of Phase I, and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, working prototypes for each component of proposed tool will be developed, including: (i) the artificial intelligence Bayesian decision network engine, (ii) the chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking environ-mechanical model with supporting experimental data, and (iii) the web-based delivery interface. The outcome will be a fully functional life-cycle management tool that can make more informed decisions and guide operations without disregarding the need for simplicity and computational efficiency. Further refinement of the computational engine through subsequent phases of this project will further improve the predictive capability of proposed tool. The computational framework developed here, is directly applicable to other failure modes, across all energy industry sectors, making the commercialization of this technology extremely feasible. Not only is there an economic benefit to making better decisions that lower the risk of failure, the public benefits as well."

By decreasing the time and costs associated with safety testing, the product will make all classes of new drugs safer, less expensive and available to patients sooner. All new drugs must demonstrate that they are safe. One common and critical point at which new candidate treatments fail is because they have the serious side effect of promoting sudden cardiac death through lethal arrhythmias. This product combines advanced biological techniques with advanced computing to develop a system that will enable pharma and biotech companies to more rapidly and accurately identify pro-arrhythmic drugs earlier in the development process, thus saving drug companies significant costs associated with drug development. Drugs that ultimately fail cardiac safety screening need to be eliminated as soon as possible from the development pipeline, and certainly pre-clinically. A drug that makes it to clinical trials before cardiac side effects are identified can result in significant wasted costs, in addition to the human cost. Conversely, a drug incorrectly eliminated also can be costly, both in terms of lost revenue and benefit to society. This STTR Phase I is a proposal to improve the extraction of key data from experiments on the HERG ion channel and its interpretation through computational modeling in the new FDA CiPA initiative. Preclinical safety testing currently focuses on two interdependent questions: 1) Does the drug block the HERG channel? and 2) Does the drug prolong the action potential? The CiPA initiative proposes to integrate this process systematically, through screening of a defined set of cloned ion channels in high throughput systems and combing this with action potential modelling through the qNet index. The HERG channel is handled separately using a complex state-dependent block model that due to its complexity requires very difficult and time consuming manual measurements. This proposal will automate this process by using a real-time interface to computer model block and evaluate the information coming from voltage clamp experiments as they occur. As such it will be an artificial intelligence that will substitute for the judgement of a human experimenter by focusing only on protocols and exposure times that define the kinetics of a particular drug.

Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods. A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients. Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches. This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research. The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology. In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training. The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%. Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses. Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

With the capacity for simultaneously making conventional materials lighter, stronger, and multi-functional, this material design motif has the potential to impact a wide range of technologies in hardware, manufacturing, energy-efficiency, robotics, and aerospace. This potential can be tapped by embedding carefully designed geometric patterns into materials. The current unmet challenge for realizing this potential impact is the conspicuous absence of a standard library of metamaterial designs. This project addresses the challenge by exploring the feasibility of a complete kinematic set and to determine whether the resulting physical properties are suitable for broader engineering applications. If successful, the metamaterials designed and validated by this effort will lay the foundation for replacing, augmenting, or enhancing machines of all types with mechanical metamaterial-based technology. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes an artificial intelligence-enhanced optimization scheme to automatically generate mechanical metamaterial designs meeting user-defined target properties. To generate the proposed set of kinematically-complete mechanical metamaterials the software-based approach to metamaterial design will be required to mesh with empirical validations. A combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques will be used to guarantee the metamaterial designer routinely generates useful, robust, and high-performing schematics that qualitatively and quantitatively improve as the pipeline for metamaterial design is repeatedly executed. The core algorithm improves the ability to produce high-impact metamaterial-based technology while taking less time to converge on optimized design schematics. As such, the barrier to market penetration of advanced material technology becomes lower, faster, and is driven by advances in machine learning.

Along with reading, developing mathematical proficiency is arguably one of the most important skills for young children to acquire, particularly with the growing importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in the world today. Yet standardized test scores in math remain alarmingly low, with just 40% of US fourth grade students performing at grade level. A considerable body of research now shows that these gaps often appear before a child first enters kindergarten. Strong parental engagement in a child's mathematics learning is often cited as a key indicator of future academic success, but ways to bring about this engagement remain elusive. Grounded both in computational social science and constructivist models of learning, this project aims to develop a scaleable means of targeting parental engagement and promoting positive math learning experiences for families, goals which are fundamentally aligned with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, and which could have significant social and economic impact for years to come. This project will introduce several innovations, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and data modeling. A mobile learning application will be developed that provides users with a range of on- and off-screen math activities for parent and child to engage in together. Data will be collected from short surveys repeated at regular intervals and these will be collated together with information provided by the app (learning data, time-on-task, etc.). Deep learning approaches will be leveraged to explore relationships between content, engagement, and learning measures and to suggest follow-on activities predicted to improve these outcomes. While the data set will be limited during Phase I research, the technology will be able to identify an increasing number of connections as participation becomes more and more robust over time. In Phase II, these and other instruments will describe and detect family engagement practices at more than just one point in time, with differing socio-economic groups, and in a variety of different geographies.

Highly power-efficient machine learning accelerators make training and complex inferences possible on so-called ""Edge"" devices and can revolutionize the way machine learning tasks are performed for end users. By enabling fast and power-efficient Edge computing, this innovation benefits society by reducing data traffic while preserving privacy and data security since data never leave the device.

High power-efficiency and scalability of this innovation gives it an immense competitive advantage to penetrate different segments within this market. The proposed project aims to develop a fast, scalable and area- and power-efficient matrix multiplier for machine learning applications. Matrix multiplication is at the heart of all machine learning algorithms and is the most computationally expensive task in these applications. Most hardware accelerator solutions store inputs, weights and partial sums in memory and retrieve them sequentially in order to perform matrix multiplication. The data movements between memory and computational units dominate the overall power consumption and latency of the system. By performing computations in memory, a significant power and area savings can be achieved. This SBIR project seeks to develop a technology to perform mixed-signal matrix multiplication in memory to significantly improve the speed and power- and area-efficiency of machine learning accelerators.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. X-ray mammography screening is an effective tool for reducing mortality among women, but the high volume of mammograms generated every year, combined with the visual challenges of identifying subtle abnormalities in a complex background, makes mammogram analysis a difficult task. This project proposes an AI-based system able to autonomously analyze mammograms to help radiologists in this task, with a broad dataset covering multiple demographics. The proposed solution will save the time of radiologists, allowing the healthcare system to care for women more efficiently, while providing high accuracy and reducing variability of interpretation. The proposed solution may result in a broader adherence to mammography screening programs, marked reduction in breast cancer mortality, and significant cost savings for society. Additionally, this project may lead to improved treatments of other types of cancer. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an algorithm to reduce bias in AI methods for breast imaging in order to extend their use to under-represented demographic groups. Most mammogram databases currently available to train AI models are potentially undertrained for use in under-represented populations because of the limited origin of the test and training data, potentially leading to errors or reduced accuracy when used on other populations. This project proposes a data augmentation procedure to reduce bias by synthetically increasing the number of training examples for under-represented demographics. Firstly, demographic information will be extracted from available databases, and biasing factors will be identified. Then, a new procedure will be established and used to generate highly realistic synthetic mammograms to increase the number of training examples in the original database. The benefits obtained with this procedure will be assessed by training an AI on the original and on the augmented databases and comparing performances in terms of area under the receiving operator characteristic. At the completion of this Phase I project, the augmentation procedure will be ready for testing on under-represented minorities.

Community Centers cannot afford to replace existing machines with more accurate and expensive modalities. Especially in rural communities with limited resources, few people diagnosed with cancer can afford to travel and incur the cost of staying 4-6 weeks in a local hotel to receive daily treatments from state of the art technologies located only in the wealthy institutions. Using a novel cloud-based architecture and proprietary software, this Phase II award will allow remote clinics, and any hospital, to treat patients with highly improved real-time accuracy.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the unmet need to see daily changes in anatomy throughout the course of cancer radiation treatment and effectively target only the tumor. Today, a physician designs a treatment plan and dose prescription based on images that are captured days or even weeks prior to initiation of radiation therapy, creating a margin of error around the tumor that encompasses healthy tissues. Unaccounted anatomical changes are quite frequent, leading to a diminished quality of treatment delivery, inferior outcomes, and a decreased quality of life. The phase I project investigated and developed a treatment-equipment agnostic approach to adapt the treatment to account for these anatomical changes. Phase II will focus on integrating artificial intelligence and deep neural analytics to predict two critical parameters for the treatment adaptivity: (a) treatment prognostics and (b) registration error quantification.

Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations in cost, sensitivity, and accessibility of current screening result in missing 1 in 3 cancers at early stages. Early detection is associated with lower costs of treatment that save billions of dollars in direct medical care and lost productivity annually, demonstrating a clear economic and societal benefit for better breast cancer screening platforms. The technology leverages the proven benefits of automated ultrasound and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence to expand the deployment of these systems, including lower-resource settings such as walk-in or rural clinics, pharmacies, and in the home for self-monitoring. The platform's portability, low cost, 2-minute scan time, automated analysis, and patient-centered design greatly increases the accessibility and adoption of breast cancer screening, resulting in better clinical outcomes and a reduced cost burden to the US healthcare system. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to continue development of a novel platform that combines 3D automated ultrasound with artificial intelligence (AI) for personalized and accessible breast imaging. The proposed project will improve the performance of a compact scanner and wearable accessory combination to produce repeatable images independent of operator training; this can be accomplished in under 2 minutes without expensive capital equipment, ionizing radiation, or patient discomfort. The intuitive software will enable physicians to visualize whole breast volume and accurately localize and measure lesions. AI will identify abnormal masses and predict the probability of malignancy to help physicians with accurate and fast diagnosis.

Next generation technology is expected to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing and potentially new paradigms for transformative applications such as self-driving cars and smart buildings, but new ways are needed to make appropriate chips. The proposed project will develop a technology to address this need as chipmakers meet their desired goals. The proposed project addresses challenges related to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and their components. An EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal manufacturing yield of ~65% and suffer from defectivity during fabrication of its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology. We propose a new EUV photomask which promises a higher robustness to defects, a higher manufacturing yield, better uniformity and more reusability of masks in operations and longer lifetime. The goals of the project are to evaluate new integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication process and characterize their EUV performance. More robust architectures reduce capital outlay requirements for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately bring down the cost of next generation electronics.

Our project team has been developing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models for DARPA and the Department of Defense for nearly a decade and this experience and technology has been leveraged during the conduct of the Phase I work for NOAA, where we demonstrated system feasibility.
Moving to Phase II, we are excited about the potential to develop a ‘NOAA-approved’ and permit-ready monitoring system, and we plan to leverage the permitted offshore aquaculture sites operated by our teaming partners at the University of New Hampshire (fin-fish nets), and Salem State University (mussel long lines) as initial deployment examples."

Specifically, Alphacore will develop comprehensive in-field calibration tools, including a low-cost MEMS accelerometer reference chip with thermal sensor calibration that does not require application of physical stimulus. In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by modeling pressure sensor and a capacitive accelerometer, designing electrical tests to correlate with mechanical characteristics, developing an aging simulation framework for the sensors, and designing the parametrizable self-test IP. In Phase II we will fabricate test and prototype circuits that implement and validate the work done in Phase I, as well as extend the concepts developed in Phase I to other types of sensors.This project will develop methodologies for 2-tier calibration of sensor-based machine learning systems; Front-End Calibration and Software Calibration. The goal of sensor front-end calibration is to maintain highest level of sensor performance throughout the operation. To this end, the sensor hardware is monitored and calibrated continuously in real-time based on the readings built-in self-test monitors. On the software end, there are various mechanisms to continuously monitor and calibrate the machine learning system. Software calibration will be achieved by incorporating the sensor error model into the machine learning system, adaptive boosting, and assigning a confidence level to the decisions made by the machine learning system based on residual error."

Conversely, neuromorphic computing architectures have exhibited the ability to performatively execute AI programs while meeting these criteria. Presented here is one such general purpose neuromorphic computing architecture.Based on the continuous time recurrent neural network model and instantiated upon the reconfigurable fabric of a field-programmable gate array, clusters of hardware-accelerated neurons can be evolved in real time while responding directly to environmental conditions. Preliminary work with this neuromorphic solution exceeded expectations when solving complex time-series problems while simultaneously minimizing spatial and power consumption.Unlike many existing machine learning methods, this architecture can undergo hardware evolution for novel solutions or hardware adaptivity for existing solutions that are performing below necessary thresholds. Circuits undergoing intrinsic hardware evolution or adaptation exhibit naturally occurring fault tolerances as a result of real world environmental noise. These inherent phenomena make the continuous time recurrent neural network in evolvable hardware a powerful candidate for extraterrestrial and spacefaring operation."

Unless these decisions are explained in a human understandable form, the end-users are less likely to accept them and certification personnel are less likely to clear these systems for wide use. Explainable AI (XAI) is an AI algorithm whose actions can be easily understood by humans. Phase I of this SBIR developed EXplained Process and Logic of Artificial INtelligence Decisions (EXPLAIND)mdash;a prototype tool for verification and validation, as well as in-operation explanation of AI-based aviation systems. We successfully used EXPLAIND to generate reliable, human-understandable explanations for decisions made by a NASA-developed AI algorithm used to detect aircraft trajectory anomalies. Controllers participated in cognitive walkthroughs of EXPLAINDrsquo;s explanation interface, which successfully explained the rationale behind one frequently detected anomaly type. EXPLAIND thus represents an important step towards user acceptance and certification of AI-based decision support tools (DSTs). In Phase II, we propose to build on the successful Phase I technology to create a commercial, licensable, universally-applicable, cloud-based AI explainability software platform. We pursue three thrusts in Phase II: (1) Operationalize EXPLAIND for aircraft trajectory anomaly detection applications, (2) Expand EXPLAIND to be a universal explainability approach and apply it to benefit other NASA XAI research programs, and (3) Apply EXPLAIND to non-aviation applications with significant commercialization potential: computer vision systems in self-driving cars, credit rating algorithms in the financial industry, and insurance claims processing algorithms in the health insurance industry."

Truly autonomous operation of power systems (e.g. turbo-electric distributed propulsion aircrafts) cannot be scripted. An intelligent system capable of self-healing and management requires two key pillars to achieve a sufficient degree of correct self-aware behavior: a reliable accurate model of internal system behavior, and efficient and reliable ways to deal with external and internal information. As a byproduct of accurate and reliable modeling, better design procedures will be in our hands. On these areas, the innovation will extend the ideas behind the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM, which solves non-equivocally the steady-state equations of electrical power systems), to encompass a larger heterogeneous system: the joint electrical and thermal system. The innovation builds first on their joint operational physical model, seen as a holistic system of algebraic equations. The second innovation context is data processing for self-aware behavior algorithms, proposing convergence of the physical model-based approach (HELM) and emerging unsupervised Deep Learning techniques in Big Data Artificial Intelligence. The CWRU knowledge base on fault detection and protection will also contribute significantly in efficient defining self-aware heuristics.

Sensors are wirelessly, fluorescently read through the skin (continuously or on-demand) and data is transmitted to a smart phone for viewing and analysis. In this STTR, we aim to transition our successfully demonstrated glucose sensors into a biodegradable format and to apply artificial intelligence to optimize the signal accuracy. We will utilize degradable hydrogels already used in other FDA-approved degradable devices to adapt our sensors to dissolve harmlessly, leaving no lasting implant in the body after their useful life for trauma care. Furthermore, our system collects multi-parameter data streams (oxygen, temperature, etc.), and we will apply artificial intelligence approaches to optimize the measurement accuracy. By integrating a machine learning approach into the analysis, different characteristic signatures will be inherently trained into the signal interpretation to ultimately lead to better closed loop glycemic control."

Producing a consolidated taxonomy of human interpretable labels (thumbnails) and learning to automatically label the trajectories data and convey the semantic meaning of observed movement patterns would greatly assist the human users in visualizing and performing trajectory mining tasks. To aid these objectives, we offer to develop TULPA (Trajectory-patterns elucidated via Unsupervised-and-semi-supervised Labeling by Prerequisites-free Autonomy), a machine learning system for data-efficient semi-supervised training of Deep Learning algorithms to automatically perform pattern based classification and human-interpretable labeling of complex trajectories autonomously extracted from heterogeneous ISR feeds."

NGA recently created the Office of Automation, Augmentation, and Artificial Intelligence (AAA) which has a goal “to automate routine tasks to give crucial time back to employees.” These automated systems must provide high-confidence results that can be relied on by analysts. To earn this confidence, machine learning algorithms require large training data sets with highly accurate labels. The image analysis process to compile this training data is tedious, not engaging, and often outright boring. We propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Gamified Analysis Tasks for Heightened Engagement across Repetitions (GATHER). GATHER produces training data for automated image intelligence algorithms using a gamified framework for geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) production and verification. Within this framework we develop “At the Map’s Edge,” a novel, lightweight survival-crafting game, to shape narratives around gamified analysis tasks that motivate analysts to perform high quality, efficient image content extraction.

This range is impressive, but it assumes/takes advantage of only one bounce off of the ionosphere. The capability to take advantage of multiple bounces (hops) has the potential to greatly expand the detection and tracking range of an OTH radar. Indeed, the Earth-ionosphere waveguide supports HF propagation over transcontinental distances, so it is tempting to exploit this phenomenon to double or triple the range of the existing system.

In addition to this, in some environmental conditions a submarine could hide between layers of different temperatures or different salt concentrations that greatly influence the sound propagation and make the target even harder to detect. In a shallow-water archipelago, these problems are further compounded by strong reverberation effects, caused by sound reflection from the sea floor, the surface, and islands, which lead to subsequent interference phenomena.The proposed technique includes three major steps. The first step is to remove the random noise by wavelet based denoising processing. The second step is to enhance the contrast of signal source of interest from acoustic signal. The third step is to isolate the signal sources of interest from acquired acoustic signal. The third step involves feature extraction processing, waveform matching processing, and AI based deep learning processing."

Common ravens are serious pests of agriculture and attack many threatened and endangered species but nest in locations out of reach from the ground. Three years of development work on remote oiling of raven’s eggs by team partner Hardshell Labs has resulted in a drone system capable of reaching all raven nests, including in electrical transmission towers. BWCS has worked extensively on artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of recognizing a variety of natural objects and organisms. We will join forces to create a remote egg-oiling (REO) drone capable of autonomously navigating to electrical tower raven nests, transmitting images of the nest to an operator on the ground and, when triggered, to deliver a stream of oil accurately to the eggs.

The resulting system provides a mechanism for Navy operators and DoD algorithm designers to leverage existing model-based ATR algorithms, with a known threshold of baseline-performance, to systematically design deeper and more-robust neural-network-based algorithms that can be naturally optimized and augmented using modern machine-learning approaches. Furthermore, while the proposed algorithmic framework is largely agnostic to the particular imaging-modality, we demonstrate how it can be specifically tuned to discover features that are unique to particular modalities, in either the spatial or the spatial-frequency domain, mitigating uncertainties that arise in various environmental or"

However, maintenance is often time-consuming and riddled with mistakes, resulting in operational and financial consequences. Furthermore, the most critical maintenance personnel â€“ those that are highly advanced â€“ are those in highest demand and lowest supply. As a result, we propose a solution that combines the power of existing turbomachinery virtual modeling software with an augmented reality landscape to improve maintenance efficiency. The SoftInWay-patented software, AxSTREAM, allows users to view critical aircraft turbomachinery in a virtual environment and determine how best to improve their hardware. Through an add-on modification to the AxSTREAM software, we plan to leverage the power of augmented reality to diagnose problems and recommend solutions to maintenance engineers in an intuitive manner. Furthermore, the proposed software solution will also integrate artificial intelligence to analyze data, providing better diagnoses and more reliable recommendations. Using our proposed solution, aircraft maintainers of various skills can operate more efficiently without relying on a limited supply of specialized knowledge. Ultimately, aircraft maintenance crews will be able to conduct their operations more effectively, reaping vast benefits for the entire Air Force."

An increasing complexity of digital and mixed-signal systems makes establishing the authenticity of a chip to be a key problem. New rapid, inexpensive, and non-destructive technology is needed to address this problem. We will develop a new terahertz AI testing technique for non-destructive identification of genuine integrated circuits, even in-situ and even under bias, by measuring their response to terahertz and/or sub-terahertz radiation at the circuit pins and using AI algorithms for the response classification and interpretation. A big advantage of this new technique compared to other radiation enhanced testing is that this new approach does not affect the device operation. In contrast to the conventional THz imaging, this technique will use the intensity, polarization, frequency, and bias dependences of the THz response at the VLSI or MMIC pins. Our recent results demonstrated that this technique allowed for the unambiguous identification of the MMIC defective transistors."

An estimated 70% of the world's littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands with scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely. Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence for amphibious landings and accurate assessment of the environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development. The resulting geospatial products will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment. The proposed project addresses the challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite-derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different physical parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval to form complementary measurements. Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column. Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metaocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation; and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values. The shallow seafloor is a dynamic and poorly understood domain due to the complexity of the environment and navigational dangers of accessing unknown waters. The project's goal is to create a remotely produced, automated, self-validating satellite-based shallow seafloor mapping system by implementing artificial intelligence, advanced remote sensing and computer science algorithms and ongoing collection of earth observation imagery to globally produce 10-30 m resolution bathymetry elevation models.

For this Phase I project SARA intends to fuse our IRamp;D developed TRL-6 PANCAS target tracking technology with an acoustic array specifically targeted to the FVR-90 UAV enabling the safe, efficient, and successful execution of Beyond‑Visual-Line‑Of‑Sight (BVLOS) missions by providing the air platform with a means to Detect-And-Avoid (DAA) potential collision events with non-cooperative aircraft in addition to enabling the capability of Acoustic-Multiple-Target-Of-Interest tracking and characterization. All BVLOS missions for UAVs require systems which provide the onboard artificial intelligence (advanced autopilot) or Pilot-In-Control (PIC) a steady feed ofnbsp; situational awareness data to minimize the probability of a collision with nearby aircraft; the proposed array will be capable of measuring and reporting this required data with the added capability of allowing for the identification, characterization, and tracking of acoustically emissive nearby targets (nearby aircraft, ldquo;Go-fastrdquo; boats, and any other surface targets that make noise). The convolution of SARArsquo;s PANCAS system with the proposed FVR-90 tailored acoustic array provides the platform a capability to Acoustically Detect and Range targets while providing a massive Improvement in Situational Awareness and thus has been named (ADRISA).

Our proposed system, Anomaly Detection via Topological feature Map (ADTM), will use Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based architecture to produce high-resolution clusters of nominal system behavior. What distinguishes SOMs from more common clustering techniques (e.g., k-means) in the ISHM-space is that they map high-dimensional input vectors to a 2D grid while preserving the topology of the original dataset. ADTM will use SOMs as the building blocks for a hierarchical case-based model of a system. Using a combination of case-based reasoning (CBR), clustering, and classification techniques, ADTM will detect, predict, and explain anomalies, and guide users in implementing effective mitigations. This approach provides the critical ability to handle previously unknown anomalies and faults. An additional feature of ADTM is the ability to cross-correlate subsystems in order to capture the cascading effect of faults from one subsystem to another, as well as discover latent relationships between subsystems.nbsp; Such analysis would significantly aid in the maintenance activities of NASArsquo;s deep-space missions. ADTM will include tools to allow users to visualize the status of the system at various levels of granularity, configure and receive alerts about current or predicted future faults, and navigate the system models to trace root causes.nbsp;The Phase I effort implemented prototype versions of ADTMrsquo;s SOM-based clustering and classification techniques. The prototype was successfully demonstrated on three real-world datasets from NASA and on one simulated dataset for a CubeSat.

This innovation applies recent advancements from the field of artificial intelligence to spacecraft guidance and control. NN technology for EP automation has two key benefits: 1) the accuracy and optimality of running an onboard sophisticated program, and 2) a low computational requirement similar to legacy linear control architectures.nbsp;
The innovation enables increased spacecraft autonomy and makes spacecraft robust to large errors or large changes in target trajectory. Legacy onboard control algorithms are incapable of maintaining a spacecraft in highly sensitive orbits such as Earth-Moon libration point orbits (including NRHOs). Spacecraft with EP systems currently rely on frequent ground contacts in order to get updated thrust instructions. The proposed innovation will enable spacecraft with EP to autonomously follow a nominal path or rendezvous with another spacecraft in sensitive regimes, without significant onboard computation. The innovation benefits a wide variety of NASA projects, particularly the Lunar Orbiting Platform - Gateway, which will operate in this sensitive regime with an electric propulsion based Power and Propulsion Element.nbsp;
Example applications and benefits of the proposed innovation include: reducing operational costs for constellations of spacecraft, enabling EP spacecraft to perform transfers which are too sensitive for ground-in-the-loop control, autonomous stationkeeping in sensitive orbits, and ground-based Monte Carlo analyses of sensitivity and/or contingency cases.

New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular
disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary
CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of
progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that
prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome
the barriers – a new approach is needed.
Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer
Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked
to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy;
vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software
available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect
accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to
effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it
achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid
mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel
reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP
has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS.
Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved
meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through
direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to
pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse
events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on
the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial
intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of
available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale
up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials.
While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support
multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also,
vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These
attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.Project Narrative

The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approachdefined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The
CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high-
throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks fortorsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by
measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived
human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost ofcardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4
million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug inducedarrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical
companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development.
Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived
from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In
addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of
human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool.
To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast-
Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and
CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm oursuccessful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recentlypublished protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this
validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced
changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from
same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an
artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds.
After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac
safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing
any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safetylaboratories or biotech firms.Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety
concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve
productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and
experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor
heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac
safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to
arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments
using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers."

detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear.
Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush
pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive
tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells
without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our
report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal
trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal
DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum,
which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a
fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this
technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using
custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped
the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which
includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1
and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies
revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and
andlt;40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We
will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci
into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and
innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative
method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput
cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial
intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an
estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned
technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our
initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information
to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit
pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia.This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal
cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify
women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be
commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other
hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will
generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and
their babies."

Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents,
and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics
alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer,
inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein
therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important
properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving
protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which
has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language
processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI
and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict
beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other
techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and
explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank
database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad
range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of
sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced
automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBankandapos;s depth and breadth makes it an ideal data
source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and
ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable
computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML
models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to
discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties.
Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein
engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding
and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data
deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other
databases.
!Project Narrative
Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development
of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic
diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in
diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial
intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI
approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our
recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics
and reagents are discovered and developed.!"

According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the
number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline,
short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or
activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236
billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease
management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel
and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly
individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial
Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel

uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is
$113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial
infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management
of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has
developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive
nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive,
and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical
reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when
needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the
EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the
requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with
the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an

randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will
investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC).
The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of
study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by andgt;6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will
be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization,
error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima
IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data

Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all
deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective
advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in
1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications
system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech
Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored
specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical
decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered
clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and
reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the
improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the
company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop
CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence.
Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and
rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets
clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10)

enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more
than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions
(n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical
community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold
ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated
in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce
patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study
results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further
development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend
as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased
efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted.Project Narrative
Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients,
nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient
communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement
organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision
support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the
number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing

Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits
rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The
current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record
is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting
the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating
patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be
configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It
supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project,
we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment
centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart
checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the
ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over
the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data
translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and
verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the
feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent
patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve
cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits.Project Narrative
Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in
the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods
of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error
detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and
comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy.
ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency

In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six
for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent
hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities
of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by
reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing
the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology
not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur.
Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the-
shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias
(ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time,
confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to
the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours
after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational
Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient
space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning
(a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last
check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls).

memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:· Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept datacontaining 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection.
· Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facilityfrom the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This ledto clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an OccupationalTherapist (OT) to re-organize patient space.
· Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention).
· Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, withreal-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, whichprovides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of thenumber of falls, with the 100 patients.
In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care
called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of
our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical
feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-
time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need
for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing
interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in
rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In
Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with
sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist
control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that
require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.Narrative
The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real-
time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a
comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou
Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf
wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias
(ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will
perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-
stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want
to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive
gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be
proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate
for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In
Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a
waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard-
of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce
number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.
The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and
skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots. Past results demonstrated an
80% decrease in the fall rate in a single facility over the course of a three months period."

intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older
adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial

personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association
an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages.
Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood,
depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans
suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of
over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating
AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and
emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering
from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such
technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years.
While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped
with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR
(prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our
game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills”
abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio-
emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant
financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and

In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the
top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations,
where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall
safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the
likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the
number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been
developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently
and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe.
Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian,
an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for
residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that
push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the-
loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities
(defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep
learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in
particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research
Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL
is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial
intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen
within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from
our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference
and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space
(intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning
approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms
the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project
leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner
communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner
networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:· Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).· Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family andstaff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our firstpartner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefitsincluding an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT.
· Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention).
· Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform
real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner
company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities.
We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was
reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and
the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%.
The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary
trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will
use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored
with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also
benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover.Narrative
The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou
Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here
as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care).
The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off-
the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls
right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess
need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate
incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce
the risk of repeat falls.
The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and
demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm
per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk
when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through
reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review."

About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7
billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting
in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%)
among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of
stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the
common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over
$130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a
widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff andamp; nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the
bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense,
patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their
efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced,
human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients,
avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff
to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed
hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century
Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care
environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an
outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.Narrative

2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely
to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, andamp; Walter, E,
2000; Kokkelenberg andamp; Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families,
women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010;
Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett andamp; Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg andamp; Sinha, 2010). Improving math
learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential
foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics
and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to
transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an
engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and
Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual
understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a
digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects
to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the
economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students
use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’
reasoning skills.
Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for
detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms
for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict
math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared
to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The
discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby
improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging
game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics.
Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary
school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced
math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen,
2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM.There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes
students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to
pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including
mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in
Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes,
such as increased STEM majors and careers."

Within the computing industry, cybersecurity tools on the market today are largely structured to detect ‘known bad’ entities (malware, viruses, etc). Adversaries are generating malware and finding new vulnerabilities faster than security software companies can respond; the approach today is very much based on prevention by securing systems using best practices and tools for detection of known threats. The detection methods search for ‘known bad’ signatures. However, using advanced computing capabilities such as automated machine learning, it is possible to develop methods for identifying previously unknown threats and to potentially stop unknown malware before it impacts system functionality. To detect unregistered threats, that is threats that have not been identified previously, a new paradigm for the basis of detection is proposed in this research.

Limitations in rapid geographic positioning combined with a very short boost-phase duration makes intercepts very challenging. During the critical post-boost and subsequent midcourse phases, when the missile becomes much colder, missile tracking signatures can be lost. A Space Sensor Layer comprised of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites equipped with radar or optical-based sensors could detect, track, and distinguish warheads from decoys and debris during midcourse and could complement an infrared-based system. Compatibility issues and information exchange delays, however, could affect performance since LEO satellites are limited in size weight and power. Machine Learning approaches for analytics extraction provide significant performance and power saving advantages over conventional methods. Lucid Circuit, a Los Angeles-based startup, is developing an adaptable Artificial Intelligence microchip called AstrumTM for cognitive aerospace applications. By enabling machine learning in LEO space platforms, many risks and challenges are mitigated. Only the resulting critical analytics are transmitted - making them available to other satellites and strategists on the ground in real-time. LEO satellites will be able to perform distributed cognitive analytics while ensuring intelligent data attestation."

Unbiased stereology allows neuroscientists to accurately analyze the size and number of brain cells, which are altered in many neurological disorders and mental illnesses. For reasons that are currently unknown, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are all associated with a progressive loss of brain cells. In contrast, children with autism are born with too many brain cells, which leads to life-long problems in processing complex streams of information. Stereology plays an important role in investigating many conditions affecting the brain and assessing the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. Though the proposed technology will initially target research studies to understand and treat all neurological conditions, it can be useful for automatic assessments of cells in all tissues, including cancer screening and diagnosis from biopsies. The proposed project will develop and optimize an algorithm to help brain scientists identify causes and treatments for neurological disease and mental illness. The proposed technology will use deep learning (artificial intelligence) systems to automatically recognize, count and size brain cells on tissue sections. An important use of this technology will be to analyze brains and nerve tissue from mice and rats treated to show similar neurological diseases as those found in humans. These animal models provide a powerful tool for testing treatments to cure brain disease in humans. Currently stereology studies of tissues from these animals require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen making tedious manual counts of hundreds and thousands of microscopic cells. This outdated approach fails to take advantage of powerful deep learning methods proposed for the proposed software that could complete these tasks 10 times faster and with fewer errors and human biases. Therefore, the proposed technology will use deep learning technology to accelerate basic research and drug development in the U.S., thereby establishing a long-term economic engine and bringing significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries."

The proposed multi-purposed BCI is expected to have immediate applications for several industries, including manufacturing and medicine. Currently, existing systems are either too expensive or limited for real-time control. The proposed BCI is specifically designed for 3 dimensional environments, and is intended to leverage multiple ('hybrid') signals from the human body to allow increased performance using affordable hardware. It is also designed for and expected to allow AR/VR control, which can enable productivity applications, as well as model BCI use in real-world scenarios. The long term goal is to enable users to scroll menus, select objects, and even type using their brain activity. The platform uses the existing form-factor of AR/VR headsets to incorporate brain-sensing electrodes, and will be compatible with popular devices, independently or in parallel with their existing controllers. The electrodes are designed to be safe, non-invasive, and dry (requiring conductive gel or saline). The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the applications of BCI systems in general, with an emphasis on AR/VR technologies. The proposed project concerns a novel hybrid BCI by combining oculomotor and electroencephalography (EEG) signals via a custom machine learning platform. BCIs detect and interpret neural signals enabling control over a variety of technologies. However, current BCIs remain extremely limited in their applicability. They either require expensive equipment, invasive surgery, or have too low performance when using affordable noninvasive hardware. This BCI aims to provide real-time control in 3-dimensional scenarios, (e.g., AR/VR/real-world smart devices), while using affordable hardware. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to combine three distinct innovations: high-performance EEG signal analysis, high-speed eye movement classification, and custom multi-signal ensemble classification techniques. Specifically, the project seeks to use a custom machine learning and artificial intelligence approach informed by physiology to combine oculomotor and EEG signals to specifically enable3D AR/VR control.

Even though robust research demonstrates both intrinsic motivation to read and print book ownership strongly shape reading achievement, few existing educational software products address them. The project will develop a voice chatbot app elementary students will use in class to receive personalized book recommendations and coaching on choosing well. An associated book subscription service will allow kids to own books they choose, including in very low income schools through partnerships with non-profits. Together, these offerings will tap a combined U.S. children's book and literacy educational software market for grades 2-5 that tops $1.4 billion dollars annually. Unlike most other ""personalized"" or ""adaptive"" learning systems, the app will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase the agency of students and teachers. It will focus on helping students improve their ability to make their own choices rather than making those choices for them. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative combination of a recommender system and a pedagogical agent to simultaneously assist students in completing an authentic task (choosing books to read independently) quickly and well while also teaching them to complete the task increasingly effectively and independently over multiple performances. The voice conversational interface will provide this combined task support and coaching through an emotionally engaging narrative experience accessible to struggling readers. The research will yield a field-tested prototype of the system, constructing a domain model, authoring conversational content, developing machine learning technology, and iteratively improving the system through usability and pilot testing in elementary school classrooms. Technical challenges include tuning automated voice recognition in naturalistic classroom environments, overcoming the cold start problem to generate high quality initial recommendations, and supporting acquisition of both cognitive and metacognitive skills within an ill-structured domain where measurement of successful performance has complex dependencies with student identity and social context."

Today?s central processing units (CPUs) each contain 7.2 Bn chips and over 1.2 sextillion chips are manufactured per year to meet computing demands. Next generation technology is expected to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing and potentially neuromorphic paradigms, bringing to reality transformative applications such as self-driving cars and smart buildings. As Moore?s law continues to set the pace of technological advancement, chipmakers will deploy new EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography tools, using light of 13.5 nm to pattern integrated circuits or chip architecture into silicon wafers, for the next three generations of technology. Chipmakers strive to bring about the readiness of EUV technology in 2019. The global demand for next generation electronics is forever increasing as the population grows above 7 Bn. However, the global supply of electronics constantly faces challenges to reduce costs and deliver technology beyond Moore?s Law. The proposed project addresses the challenges related to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and its components. For example, an EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal manufacturing yield of ~60% and suffer from defectivity which arises during fabrication of its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology. A new EUV photomask which promises greater robustness to defects, a higher manufacturing yield, more reusability of masks in operations and a longer lifetime is presented. The goals of the project are to evaluate new integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication process and characterize the EUV performance. More robust photomasks reduce the capital outlay required for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately bring down the cost of next generation electronics."

In the post-secondary education and training domains, market inefficiencies require excess spending on both sides of the transaction, adversely affecting both supply and demand. As the nation continues to deliberate the value of higher education in the face of $1.3 billion in student loan debt, streamlining the college application process by matching students and institutions based on an applicant?s career goals can reduce costs for students, their families, and institutions alike. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces where employer-employee matching algorithms will be used in recruiting, hiring, training, and team building, across the domains of health, innovation, national defense, and beyond. Ultimately, people analytics platforms have unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus generating tax revenue, creating jobs, and otherwise bolstering the economy. The proposed project focuses on the deployment of people analytics in the domain of college and career readiness and success. While talent evaluation through such innovative software is in its infancy, the small company's approach to college match will revolutionize how students identify their professional goals and then optimize their college experience for successful life launch. The small company's team of behavioral and data scientists, game designers, and software engineers, are creating video games that provide insights into a college applicant's career potential. Their platform captures massive amounts of micro-behavioral data -- how long players hesitate before making a move, persistence in the face of challenge or frustration, ability to parallel process -- to create a psychographic profile of the player's career-critical characteristics, including traits like competitiveness, extroversion, risk tolerance, and other enduring, personal traits difficult to discern through resumes and traditional, college application materials. Once a student's career objectives become clear, the company's proprietary recommendation engine suggests educational institutions and curricula best suited to attain the player?s career goals. In addition to expanding the game platform and collecting player data to develop and fine tune predictive algorithms, this project also will examine factors that influence a player's response to the insights and recommendations the platform provides. This work will investigate the impact of transparency, or ""scrutability"", of game-based assessments and implement visualization tools that promote the player's understanding of why specific recommendations are made."

This is part of a growing trend towards ""alternative data"" products relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Besides the financial industry, there are numerous potential applications of controversy detection technology in a variety of market verticals, such as crisis management, defense applications, and advertising technology. Beyond commercial applications, there is scope for social impact by opening analysis and explanatory power of controversies to individual users. Controversies have a massive impact on civic society and the so-called ""filter bubble"" exacerbates polarization, both political and otherwise; fake news on both sides of the political spectrum has recently captured public attention and generated political concern. Positive impact on society from commercializing this technology includes helping users become better informed and more capable of critically evaluating the often-overwhelming stream of online content. Proving the feasibility of this innovation in a highly quantifiable space such as finance could answer a customer need in that space and create new jobs for the economy, while enabling social good applications that can improve civic society. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies on sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques to automatically detect controversial topics. The initial data were collected at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, using NSF-supported research, which recognized controversy by mapping the text of a webpage to algorithmically-identified controversial topics. Research has demonstrated that controversy cannot be detected using existing methods of sentiment analysis, a widely-adopted natural language processing method. This project bridges the gap between the current capabilities of this nascent technology and the clear user need in the financial domain. It will evaluate the feasibility of controversy detection by applying a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data to reduce risk and increase returns.

The proposed innovation makes important educational outcomes such as deep understanding, cognition (thinking skills) and awareness of thinking (metacognition) measurable. Reliable assessment of these outcomes has broad significance to education and society writ large, as many employers struggle with skills gaps between high school and college graduates and the professional, personal and societal demands on adults in the 21st Century. This research combines cognitive science, epistemology, systems science, and complex systems with new developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, and aligns well with the NSF's mission to promote progress in science and advance national prosperity. This project not only has the potential to impact core tenets of educational practice - including how teachers teach, how learners learn, and how we measure and understanding knowledge - but also may have impact on science through increased ability to map and analyze patterns and common structures in knowledge and generally for Americans to increase their developmental skills and abilities. Beginning in an educational market valued at $8-15 billion, this project has the potential to catalyze significant job creation and have significant commercial impact across a range of related industries. This SBIR Phase I project introduces a visual grammar for mapping ideas in a canvas-based environment, and provides a neural-network based mechanism for quantitatively comparing expressions of complex ideas along many dimensions to facilitate a new approach to thinking, learning, and assessment. Maps of ideas will be tokenized and serialized and then fed through a recurrent neural network model to produce encoded numeric vector representations that are meaningfully comparable in their encoded form. Once in this form, vectors will be compared and evaluated for content and structure similarity, and insights offered in many dimensions: depth of detail, understanding of relationships, and numerous other meaningful measures. These vectors enable scalable, consistent, constructive assessment in a way not previously possible. In the mapping environment, teachers and students will create maps either on their own, or collaboratively together in real-time. As users create maps, we use the generated vectors to analyze both content and structure, and then prompt users to think about their subject matter from new perspectives. As a means of evaluation, teachers will create mapping activities for students to complete, and then student maps will be quantitatively compared to the standards and target maps which represent the complete understanding of the topic.

Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

This project will advance from creatively assembling existing active optics hardware to inventing a new microfiber-based active optics system to circumvent limits of space confinement and 3D resolution. The project's fundamental strategy for identifying pre-cancers of the cervix, which relies on a macroscopic 3D digital analysis combined with microscopic cell evaluation, is naturally amenable to artificial intelligence technologies. The versatility of this imaging platform enables the resolving of medical diagnostic challenges in wealthy settings and the resolving of cost-saving barriers in resource-limited settings. The imaging technology can be extended beyond medical practice to other scientific and industrial disciplines. Potentially, this project has an immediate impact on saving lives and costs via the early detection of fatal diseases. Additionally, the data and knowledge acquired developing and implementing this imaging system provide opportunities to meaningfully develop new computational strategies for educational, engineering and industrial interests. The innovative, commercially viable, platform technology offers opportunities for significant, tax-revenue-generating global profits, for future technology application spin-offs, and for producing high technology jobs for U.S. citizens. The project innovation will voyage from state-of-the-art 3D software development to the creation of a new type of fiber bundle imager with an electronically controlled actively focusing lens. Combined, these tasks achieve the creation of a miniaturized 3D imaging system capable of navigating confined spaces within the body, such as inside the cervix opening. For all prototypes developed for this project, final 3D renderings are enabled by proprietary 3D rendering software, capable of quantifying tissue color, volume and shape at the macroscopic level, while also evaluating cell size and approximate shape at the microscopic level. In wealthy settings, this system would be desirable for implementing a single-phase cervical cancer screening strategy to replace the current two-phase approach, which requires Pap smear and/or human papilloma virus assay, followed by the more expensive colposcopy in the case of an abnormal result. In resource-limited regions and/or regions with difficult-to-reach populations, where it is challenging to get patients to return for a follow-up visit, the technology would offer a low-cost, pre-screening method that only requires a single visit. This 3D imaging system could be combined in the future with a therapeutic agent administered at the time of diagnosis, thus offering a single-visit, screen-diagnose-and-treat method.

Children who learn or practice music have shown better results in STEM subjects. However, studies also suggest children opt out of music class based on false belief that they lack musical ability and many kids often find the music practice non-engaging, and boring eventually losing interest and quitting. Parents find it challenging to entice the kids to sit down and practice or they cannot help their kids because either they don?t have time or are not music savvy themselves to help them. The virtual music helper can read the kids? music homework, guide them through the exercise and provide immediate correction. This helper is not to replace teachers, but help the parents at home and encourage kids to practice more. In broader terms this project may spur significant research in finding effective methods for tutoring kids in subjects other than music such as math or language, or for kids with special needs. This SBIR Phase I project proposes a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) that is empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality for kids.

Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications. The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology.

The tool will use the machine learning algorithms to calculate each sensor’s probability of attack, and artificial intelligence to trigger automatic countermeasures as well as alert plant personnel. A prototype will be implemented to establish a proof-of-concept, demonstrate fetching and analysis of sensor data, and integrate a blockchain-based approach as a security solution.

Unless the decisions are explained in a human understandable form, the human end-users are less likely to accept them, and in the case of aviation applications, certification personnel are less likely to clear systems with increasing levels of autonomy for field operation. Explainable AI (XAI) are AI algorithms whose actions can be easily understood by humans. This SBIR develops EXplained Process and Logic of Artificial INtelligence Decisions (EXPLAIND), which is a prototype tool for verification and validation of AI-based aviation systems. The SBIR develops an innovative technique called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) for making the learning in AI algorithms more explainable to human users. LIME generates an explanation of an AI algorithm’s decisions by approximating the underlying model in the vicinity of a prediction by an interpretable one. We apply LIME to a NASA-developed aircraft trajectory anomaly detection AI algorithm (MKAD) to provide a proof-of-concept. EXPLAIND represents an important step towards user acceptance and certification of multiple AI based decision support tools (DSTs) and flight-deck capabilities planned to be developed under NASA’s System Wide Safety and ATM-eXploration projects.

Reliability of UASs in unforeseen conditions is a direct function of their intelligence and adaptability.The proposed project aims to take advantage of high-performance computing platforms and the state-of-the art machine learning and verification algorithms to develop a new intelligent, adaptable, and certifiable flight control system with learning capabilities. The autopilot system will be able to learn from each flight experience and develop intuition to adapt to a high level of uncertainties. To provide a high degree of assurance and to make the learning autopilot system safe and certifiable, a secondary and conventional autopilot system will be integrated based on the run-time assurance architecture. A monitor will be developed to continuously check aircraft states and envelope protection limits, and handover aircraft control to the conventional autopilot system if needed. Provable guarantees of the monitor and the controllers will be provided using formal analysis.

Currently, many UAS have some kind of conventional Computer Vision (CV) helping them in obstacle avoidance or target acquisition. Interestingly though, since 2012 Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have dramatically outperformed conventional CV algorithms in those tasks and pushed Artificial Intelligence (AI) limits in a variety of other applications including, but not limited, to object recognition, video analytics, decision making and control, speech recognition, etc. Unfortunately, the computational power required for real-time DNN operation can still only be delivered by bulky, expensive, slow, heavy and energy-hungry digital systems like GPUs.This is why Mentium  is devoted to delivering disruptive technology in the field of Machine Learning hardware accelerators, and in particular for this project, into the Deep Learning Hardware Accelerators field. Experimental data and Phase I results confirm that our hardware can deliver 100x to 1000x gain in speed and in power efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art accelerators. Our final product will be able to analyze, in real-time, big data streams coming from cameras, sensors and/or avionics and to categorize (classify) them for the purpose of decision making or object localization to achieve better navigation and collision avoidance in UAS. The same hardware processor will be deployable in the Air Traffic Systems, for real-time data analysis and decision-making. All with more than 10x reduction in cost and power consumption. This distruptive technology is based on an analog-computational core, exploiting the memory devices to carry out the computation at a physical level. Analog computation is inherently faster and more efficient than the digital one, while the in-memory computation removes the data transfer bottleneck."

We propose to develop and commercialize the next generation of low cost, low power, ruggedized, and accurate phytoplankton single cell and whole colony counting, characterization and classification system called HABStats. We will accomplish this using the following three unique and innovative approaches: 1) High-throughput color, Light Field Imaging Flow Cytometry to acquire morphological information (area, major-micro axis, granularity, color pattern, circularity, shape, etc.), combined with 2) Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy to acquire species-specific molecular information on combinations of pigments (B-Carotenes, Chlorophylls, Xanthrophylls, Phycobilliproteins, etc.), triglycerides, and amino acids and proteins. HAB toxins will be characterized and quantified by Raman spectroscopy, and 3) The optical package will be integrated into a flow cytometer-on-a-chip using acoustic focusing to center the stream of cells, and provide a small form factor instrument with a web-enabled processor. Convolutional Deep Neural Networks provide for Deep Learning data integration and
artificial taxonomist, and WiFi communications for hand-held, distributed networking, or submersible (1000 m) operations. For Water Quality Monitoring Professionals that need realtime detection and identification of toxic algae and their toxins, CoastalOceanVision’s HABStats imaging and spectroscopic innovation will provide for this need. This proposal directly addresses SUBTOPIC 8.2.1: Portable, Fast, and Intelligent Phytoplankton Species-identifier and Counter.SUMMARY OF ANTICIPATED RESULTS:
Completing the work plan in this Phase I proposal will result in a highly detailed design and feasibility report on constructing a prototype flow-through imaging instrument for quantifying and classifying phytoplankton cells, including harmful algae and their toxins in fresh and marine systems. Through building a library of spectral signatures and features extracted from 3-D images of cells, and using Deep Learning techniques like Convolutional Deep Neural Nets, the prototype will have the capability to accurately classify phytoplankton cells and characterize toxins in real-time with high throughput in a hand-held or remote networked package. The commercialization plan is to complete the prototype and its real-world testing and verification in Phase II, followed by Phase III where the instrument will be mass marketed for the detection and management of phytoplankton, both toxic and non-toxic."

In addition, uniquely combining machine learning with multi-INT sensing significantly increases the capability to detect and understand threats from physical intrusion. However, traditional security and surveillance solutions typically process and analyze sensor outputs independently without intelligently combining information between multiple sensor types - leaving the capabilities of these systems limited or predictable. Therefore, we propose an effort to research and develop improved multi-sensor analytics methods based on machine learning, specifically for forward operating bases in areas with adjacent or nearby urban environments. More specifically, we propose combining a DLRT for object (e.g., video, person, etc.) detection and tracking with the RNN-LSTM method described in the last section for combined video, signal and acoustic detection, tracking, and notification (i.e., automatic sentences or tag sequences) of threats (both objects and behavior).

The integration of RASP with JMPS will provide a foundation for implementing Artificially Intelligent Mission Planning techniques that learn from prior mission experience/data. GBL proposes to utilize its NO4-174 EA-18G Electronic Combat Automation SBIR technologies called Electronic Combat Decision Support System as a core technology that will be leveraged. RASP will provide a Distributed Intelligent Agent-based framework (DAI) to automate development of platform mission plans. The Agent-based framework implements a publish and subscribe message system to allow for collaborative and concurrent planning amongst multiple mission planning teams across security levels while minimizing the face-to-face communication that slows the mission planning process. The decentralized capability of RASP will reduce mission planning time by allowing multiple users to simultaneously plan their role in a mission vice the waterfall method of planning that is often practiced today. The intelligent agents will communicate planning information amongst necessary users to help improve the mission planning workflow and ultimately reduce the overall time and improve automation of mission planning for multi-vehicle strike mission platforms.

In doing so, the software will adhere to training best practices and align with the performance metrics that TAP has already identified as being critical to mission success in Component Commander plans. Since TAP’s processes were designed to be scalable, this software will provide a methodology for the NAE to duplicate the entire TAP process for other platforms and mission sets in a manner that is streamlined and efficient. Artificial intelligence will be applied to enable automated and semi-automated methods for collection of data, assessment of performance, and reporting of training deficiencies.

However, the design and fabrication of such lattice structures poses several challenges. From a design perspective, current methods are computationally prohibitive, or require artificial constraints that significantly reduce the design space. Furthermore, it has been observed that the resulting lattice structures are sub-optimal when compared to non-lattice-structure designs obtained through classic macro-scale optimization. From a manufacturing perspective, incorporating process constraints and accounting for lower-than-nominal structural performances into the design process has also been elusive.TDA’s proposed work addresses the SBIR topic objectives of developing an intelligent framework to design and analyze scalable lattice architectures for missile applications. Based on our team’s expertise in topology optimization, modeling for AM process and nondestructive testing, our approach consists of: (1) extend in-house conforming lattice structure optimization to include stress constraints under static and dynamic loading, (2) address process-related challenges of manufacturing, (3) use predictive modeling of lattice structure behavior under all loading to determine a statistical basis of failure propagation and risk-based decision and (4) perform experimental testing and validation using Digital Image Correlation."

The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies. The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided.

Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale. This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

In this STTR effort, we have been developing ORION, a computational framework that implements such intelligent capabilities—treating traversability assessment as a classification problem, optimal trajectory computation as a heuristic motion planning problem, and maneuver selection as a policy mapping problem. In this effort, those problems are being addressed by employing state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques such as the convolutional neural networks and sampling-based kinodynamic planning.

Behaivior is developing a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and
overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearables (like an
advanced FitBit) and artificial intelligence. Knowing in real time when someone with opioid use
disorder is at a high risk of relapsing revolutionizes the ability to intervene at the right moment to
help people stay sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the
specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone
struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high risk opioid craving/obsession state and enabled
the creation of a predictive model for just in time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid
overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and
families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. Over 23 million
Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions cost the U.S. $442 billion
per year, according to the US Surgeon General’s office. The majority of treatment tools used to
keep those in recovery sober have low or mixed success rates. Many people in recovery end up
relapsing multiple times, with the heroin relapse rate around 90%. With the technology that we
are developing, Behaivior will detect if someone in recovery is in a red alert craving or
“obsession” state and then, using artificial intelligence, we will provide support in real time by
connecting someone to a support network member and/or provide a customized digital
intervention.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human
brain’s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as
dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks.
Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains
resources. This team uses machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to
factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial focus is opioids, this
unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any
behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify
the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their
support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions, resulting in
cost and health benefits across many populations.Project Narrative
Behaivior is developing a system to predict and prevent opioid addiction relapses and
overdoses using wearables and artificial intelligence for timely interventions.
Our innovation lowers relapse and overdose rates and improves treatment adherence, which we
anticipate will mitigate pain points such as higher treatment costs insurers currently pay from
patient relapses, will reduce emergency room and first responder costs, and will ease (or
alleviate) employers’ pain points such as poorer employee productivity and the added training
and replacement costs.
Through this program, Team Behavior will explore how to best tailor our technology for our likely
first payers and validate the next potential customer segment we should pursue."

This issue has kept many voice technologies out of both the mobile and IoT markets. It is expected that the company's unique artificial intelligence platform will deliver a fully scalable, real-time software solution. Solving this challenge will make the currently noisy world of smartphones more realistic for voice technologies (like voice authentication) that to date have avoided the space. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns a novel technology that is the result of innovatively combining advanced signal processing, broadcast studio methodologies, and artificial intelligence techniques to perform aggressive separation of voice from background voices and sounds. It also automatically repairs the biometrics of the separated voice signals on the basis of empirically formulated signal-dependent rules. The technology has already been demonstrated through informal tests to be significantly better than existing technologies in separating two-person conversations from highly overlapped background voices and sounds captured on a pair of closely spaced (few centimeters) omnidirectional microphones. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to firmly establish the clear superiority of this technology over any other existing voice separation technology. The ultimate goal of the project is to demonstrate that when the proposed technology is properly optimized as a frontend to state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition or state-of-the-art automatic speaker recognition, the recognition error rates in noisy multi-voice environments are comparable to those obtained in noiseless single-voice environments."

phenomena and rheological properties in complex biological environments  Unfortunately  PT remains a niche
tool in life and physical sciences with a limited user base  in large part due to significant time and technical
constraints in extracting accurate time variant positional data from recorded movies  These constraints are
exacerbated in experiments with low signal to noise ratios or substantial heterogeneity  as frequently
encountered with nanoparticles and pathogens in biological fluids  Currently available software that attempts
to automate the movie analysis process rely almost exclusively on assigning static image filters based on
specific intensity  pixel size and signal to noise ratio thresholds  Unfortunately  when applied to actual
experimental data with substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity  the current software generally produces
substantial numbers of false positives  i e  tracking artifacts  or false negatives  i e  missing actual traces   and
frequently both  Frequent user intervention is thus required to ensure accurate tracking even when using
sophisticated tracking software  markedly reducing experimental throughput and resulting in substantial user 
to user variations in analyzed data  The time required for accurate particle tracking analysis makes PT
experiments exceedingly expensive compared to other commonly used experimental techniques in life
sciences  These same tracking analysis limitations have effectively precluded investigators from undertaking
more sophisticated  D PT  even though the microscopy capability to obtain such movies is readily available
and critical scientific insights can be gained from  D PT  To circumvent the challenges with currently available
particle tracking software  we have developed a new approach for particle identification and tracking  based on
machine learning and convolutional neural networks  CNN   CNN is a type of feed forward artificial neural
network designed to process information in a layered network of connections that mimics the organization of
real neural networks in the mammalian retina and visual cortex  Unlike most CNN imaging models that are
trained to make predictions on static images  we have trained our CNN to input adjacent frames so that each
prediction includes information from the past and future  thus effectively performing convolutions in both space
and time to infer particle locations  Similar principles of image analysis are now being harnessed by
developers of autonomous vehicle technologies to distinguish the motions of different objects on the road  We
have applied our CNN tracking algorithm to a wide range of  D movies capturing dynamic motions of
nanoparticles  viruses and highly motile bacteria  achieving at least    fold time savings with virtually no need
for human intervention while maintaining robust tracking performance  i e  low false positive and low false
negative rates   In this STTR proposal  we seek to focus on further optimization and testing of our neural
network tracking platform for  D PT  including the use of cloud computing  Aim     and extending our neural
network tracker to enable accurate  D PT  Aim     Our vision is to popularize PT as a research tool among
researchers by minimizing the time and labor costs associated with PT analysis Narrative
Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences  but unfortunately its application has
been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies  Unlike
conventional particle tracking methods  we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create
a computational neural network that can recognize objects in much the same way as the human eye  and

Analysis of reliability and related testing requires a huge amount of data management and computation. The market for software to analyze this data is currently fragmented. Most of the work is performed by using out-dated tools and generic spreadsheet-based software with little or no option for sharing the data between different parts of the work flow with ease and, hence, is neither efficient nor cost-effective. ESDIT2 LLC (DBA iT2 Technologies) is developing a novel ecosystem for test data and work flow management for semiconductor reliability testing including ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) and FA (Failure Analysis). With a powerful computational engine based on artificial intelligence and a user-friendly interface, the iT2 software automates the process of complicated analysis of very large amount of stress and test data providing easy-to- interpret pass-and-fail results while guiding the user for further debug of chip design including failure analysis. In order to lower the cost of stress testing and to improve cycle time and quality, the users will have access to a network of independent test labs and world- wide subject matter experts linked through a highly intuitive app. By reducing the cost of maintaining internal reliability labs for IC qualification, ESD test, and failure analysis, a typical semiconductor technology company will save hundreds of thousands of dollars per year as no software tool encompassing these features and depth exists in the market today. The cost saving can go even higher if these companies out-source their reliability testing entirely using iT2's network of independent labs and expert reviewers within the United States but located in different states and not just local. 
Other novel features include the capability of the analytical portion of the software is to automatically detect noise in the data for precise and accurate results and to distinguish between true and false failures. Data mining and search functions are being added. Image recognition will be incorporated for automatic failure analysis. This will be used to distinguish between different types of failure modes in an IC with little or no need for human intervention and interpretation. iT2 has strong relations with the potential customers thanks to its key players being involved in this industry for the past several years and decades and, thus, having a deep understanding of the market in question. The target clients are all major semiconductor suppliers such as Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, NXP, and Broadcom and their customers including Apple, Samsung, HP, and Sony. During Phase I, iT2 plans to complete its automated analytical solution of ESD and other reliability test data and workflow software as outlined above and release to production after the initial step of beta testing with select customers. Phase II will be the continuation of completion of external and independent lab and expert reviewer network for its customers which allow them to outsource their internal reliability test labs. Second part of Phase II will be related to the development of the mobile app for its entire ecosystem. The main commercial benefits for the semiconductor companies will be the significant time and cost savings since they will be able to efficiently perform the analysis of large amount of reliability data and reduce or eliminate the cost of operating internal reliability labs. The improvement of the standard of reliability and quality will have a direct benefit to the electronics industry and public safety in consumer, automotive, medical, and military applications."

Although many existing cybersecurity (detection or prevention) software tools have been developed, all of them have limitations and, thus, cannot deliver protection against cyberattacks in large-scale systems: Cybersecurity in a high-performance computing environment is still an open problem. A new approach must be developed that provides more intelligent shields to fend off known and new-generation cyberattacks to help secure high-performance computing facilities, infrastructure, or large-scale distributed systems. General statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. The proposed anomaly-based intrusion detection system integrates: (1) statistical analysis (based on Markov decision processes), (2) intelligent action policy, (3) machine learning techniques, and (4) an open-source intrusion detection system’s event managing engine. These provide the artificial intelligence needed to detect and mitigate both known and new cyberattacks in high-performance computing systems and hosts. The new tool allows for continuous monitoring of network traffic and/or hosts in high-performance computing clusters, detection and classification of attacks in near-real time, and response to attacks. Cybersecurity information collected from observable indicators is converted into events and system states. Sequences of system states are then analyzed using statistical analysis and compared against a “malicious behavior” profile and action policy to make intrusion detection and response decisions. Incorporation of machine learning techniques reduces false positives and false negatives. What is to be done in Phase I? A large-scale intelligent intrusion detection system architecture, framework, and algorithms will be developed to evaluate system performance. Feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by assembling and testing a technology readiness level 4 prototype. The prototype will demonstrate the capability to detect attack patterns and predict attacks in real time in a large- bandwidth (10 Gbps) network. The metrics that determine the prototype’s efficacy and performance will be identified. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. The proposed technology is expected to have widespread applications in cybersecurity including many in large simulations, computational fluid dynamics applications, fly-by-wire avionics, advanced communications, financial and healthcare services, and others. Well-known cyberattacks have cost businesses more than $10B annually. Companies are looking for intrusion detection/protection systems such as the proposed system."

What was once a reliance on water meter data for the sum of all appliances is now a detailed understanding for each individual water fixture. This unprecedented access to water usage data at an individual appliance level will provide the opportunity for increased data analytics research, predictive analytics for failure modes and maintenance scheduling, and better understanding of human consumption habits to identify and solve problems that allow organizations to meet aggressive sustainability goals. Only recently has there been an ability for hospitals to aggregate their medical information to aid research efforts to treat and cure chronic diseases and illnesses. Mobius is looking to do the same for any building owner for water, as the growing concern to continued, reasonable costing fresh water becomes even greater. The proposed project will provide the opportunity for the development of an IoT Smart Water Management System (SWMS). It will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to both identify leaks so they can be corrected before wasting precious water and energy, and provide predictive analytics for actionable insights. This will significantly improve water appliance maintenance and prevent costly water damage to properties. Further, at a macro level, it provides municipality level insight for maintenance and crisis management. The vision is to easily install these SWMS devices into any existing water fixture. It will take less than 60 seconds to install and connect to the Internet. The design goal is to be cost-effective from the start. The SWMS provides an affordable and easy way to adopt data driven decision making into current operations. The critical objectives set forth in this proposal are centered on achieving a simple ""smoke alarm"" like warning of a fault coupled with a robust analytics platform. Finally, these will be designed as highly durable IoT devices that require little or no maintenance."

With emphasis on forms of scientific reasoning, this new use of artificial intelligence, to identify language patterns associated with scientific reasoning, will allow students to improve their written laboratory reports before they are submitted, therefore freeing instructors to devote precious instructional time to preparing students for roles as practicing scientists. As the U.S. continues to experience rapid diversity growth, this focus on helping students through innovative uses of technology holds the potential to expand science education by cultivating student ability through autonomous writing and revision. Because artificial intelligence techniques are intended to expand capabilities, the techniques being used, available 24/4 on the web, will have the direct impact of growing our technical and scientific workforce, thus expanding the many dynamic pathways to STEM occupations. As the NSF observed in 2015 in its report Revisiting the STEM Workforce, these jobs are extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness and are essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness. An investment in such a technology is thus an investment in national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and workforce diversity. NSF SBIR support will be used to design and launch artificial intelligence techniques based on Deep Artificial Neural Network (DANN) as driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the latest advances in AI algorithms. Because NLP and LSA techniques are presently used solely to identify grammatical and organizational patterns, the application of DANN is high risk in making a leap from identifying patterns of language use to capturing patterns of scientific reasoning. Trained on a proprietary corpus of 100,000 lab reports scored and annotated by instructors and students using a single rubric, the AI application will identify logic structures of scientific reasoning in student laboratory reports. Once methodically identified, categorized according to ability level, and validated by STEM instructors, digital instruction will be used to help students improve their scientific reasoning processes.

Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2 minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact 3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data. The QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes. The system architecture allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast phantom."

Enhancing existing Technology-The Flower Software application will apply cognitive artificial intelligences to perform big data analysis and automatically scan data that will enable systems to perform self-healing functions to recover from component failures and attacks. This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase 1 project is aimed at enhancing Flower software technology that automatically integrate and analyze both structure and unstructured data from the network for analysts to be able to counter and proactively prevent attacks on the network from external and internal threats on the systems by applying HPC behavior analytics that will generate predictive threat and risk assessments that will provide remediation mechanisms to alleviate adverse attack on the network from Cyber criminals and recovery actions. The long-term benefits would secure the most crucial asset which is data. The investment in Cyber Security would outweigh the costs of having to spend millions of dollars on recovering from a cyber-attack. Organizations are starting to recognize that the costs are substantial when it is a longer timeframe to detect and contain a data breach. The SBIR innovation will provide a return on investment to organizations who are investing in cyber security technologies due to the reduction of costs of lost data, business and customers. Companies are likely to lose customers due to data breaches which increase the costs of not investing in cyber prevention technologies. Regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services face higher costs of data breaches because of fines and loss of customers and business. The tools would help reduced the need for additional skilled Cyber analysts. Security professional can leverage the tools to automatically access data versus manually gathering data. We propose customer purchase Flower as a Software as a Service On premise or n a Cloud model. Many customers are adopting this economy of scale because of cost savings versus paying for service consulting fees to companies as a one-time engagement. We are flexible to customer who would like to us the consulting service model of engagement. The project will develop Flower for enhanced functionalities such as: (i) tools to analyze massive data for meaningful insight to detect anomalies with the help of cognitive technology to scan data faster; (ii) provide recommendations based on events and patterns in the data and steps for remediation; (iii) automation of analyzing data for Cyber analyst for different data sources (iv) repository to store captured date; (v) Graphic user interface for visualization tool for analysts to capture real time data; (vi) Enable analysts to predict certain outcomes based on patterns and situations, behavior analysis."

While there are tremendous potential economic and environmental benefits in the development of this resource, high up‐front installation costs and lack of confidence in the performance of geothermal heat pump systems are significant market barriers to the adoption of this technology. Collection and analysis of data from actual geothermal heat pump systems was identified by the Department of Energy (EERE/BO, 2012) as the number one research priority for reducing these two significant barriers to widespread adoption of geothermal heat pump technology. This project proposes an industry/research university partnership to develop new advanced methods of analyzing the increasingly available geothermal heat pump data. These analysis methods will quantify performance, with greater confidence and fidelity than those currently available. Performance metrics will be developed and quantified for each of the three system components: 1) the ground loop heat exchanger, 2) the heat pump equipment, and 3) the building envelope. The Phase 1 research will apply methods developed in the field of artificial intelligence to diagnose the performance of these mechanical systems and statistical methods to quantify the confidence of the performance metrics. These new methods of analysis will be incorporated into a software product with the capability to interface with web‐enabled heat pump monitoring systems that are currently available on the market. End users will be provided with an array of performance metrics, with greater confidence, that are each directly tied to components of the geothermal heat pump system. Early adopters of the software are expected to include utilities interested in evaluating incentive programs, developers looking to issue performance guarantee contracts, and investors interested in third‐party ground loop ownership. Each of these customers are reluctant to enter the market due to a lack of confidence in geothermal heat pump system performance and the absence of an efficient means to administer their respective programs. The software product will reduce the critically important confidence gap, lead to improved designs and heat exchanger materials, and provide new insights into the role that subsurface conditions play in overall system performance."

    and    mm Hg or higher  is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U S 
The estimated prevalence is     among all U S  adults and increases with age to affect     of seniors 
Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease  global mortality  and ranks third among
the causes of disability  Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward  but patient adherence to long 
term self care strategies is problematically low  Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in
order to help lower their BP are    Taking medications as prescribed by a physician     Monitoring blood
pressure at home  and    Limiting dietary sodium intake  Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and
currently ranges from     to      the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for
these three activities with the help of new technology  In particular  this STTR will develop and test an incentive
program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens  and
precipitate reduction in BP  The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with
clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California   San Diego community  The product to be
developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones  which incorporates financial and
targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific  mental accounts  to maximize the behavioral
effectiveness of the intervention  The approach is to     Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive
strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers  support self efficacy  and complement intrinsic
motivators  and     Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state of the art telehealth
technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and
reduce BP  The telehealth innovation centers on  a  Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement
to establish behaviors   b  Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time

Devices that can accurately measure the solid flow rate of an operating multi-phase flow system would be of great aid for optimizing and controlling the energy generation processes in advanced reactors. Presently, the availability of such devices, particularly at high temperatures and pressures, is very limited. Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) has emerged as a viable technology for addressing instrumentation requirements in various energy related multi-phase flow systems. ECVT, in its basic form, is based on passive sensors that measure flow components in real-time. Advanced instrumentation requires active capacitance sensors that can change their design; toward higher measurement accuracy;  based on process variables. In this Phase II A effort, we will continue building a functional prototype of an Adaptive Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (AECVT) system for mass-flow gauging of solids or liquids in energy reactors at high pressures and temperatures. AECVT is distinguished from ECVT in its ability to incorporate intelligence in the sensor formations. This feature enables the sensors to change their design, electronically, toward higher measurement resolution. It also allows artificial intelligence algorithms to be incorporated in instrumentations that use AECVT sensors. Using AECVT, mass flow measurements at 5% spatial resolution and 1 Hz temporal resolution will be possible. Phase II A will address further R&D activities required to develop the first prototype. On Phase I and II, the electronic hardware was developed and fabricated for the first adaptive system. Phase II A involve testing of the developed hardware, intelligent algorithm development, and fabrication of high temperature/pressure adaptive sensor for demonstration, software development with graphical user interface, and testing of fully integrated demonstration system. Benefits of this technology include spurring economic growth by introducing a new intelligent instrumentation to the market, helping the advancement of energy generation process by providing accurate real-time flow information to process operators, increasing efficiencies in various energy generating processes, and controlling emissions for safer operation of energy plants."

As discussed in the Technical Merits below, the proposed AFM is fast, smart, and more powerful in terms of imaging and probing local mechanics. The company has a track record of commercializing AFM controllers that are compatible with most all types of scanners, commercial and home-constructed. Current AFM users can purchase the new scanner and/or controller to attain the enhanced performance. In addition, new AFM users are also anticipated especially in the areas of nanomaterials, devices and sensors, and multidimensional devices and materials where both high spatial and temporal resolutions are paramount. Further, the combined high spatial resolution in conjunction with fast speed shall result in immediate advances in the fields of material development, surface coating, nanomaterial and nanodevice inspection and quality control, nanolithography, and tissue engineering. Based on current market trends, sales are anticipated to reach $25M within the first three years. The amount is likely higher given the forecasted growth of the global microscopy market. The intellectual merit of this project includes three cutting edge improvements to current AFM: (1) faster image acquisition speed; (2) automated and rapid feature finding and tracking; (3) 1-2 orders of magnitude of improvement in speed and efficiency in nanomechanical imaging. The ultra-high speed will be achieved by implementing a novel reconfigurable processor optimized for AFM into a unique hybrid, low-noise controller architecture, which is highly versatile and compatible with various known configurations of AFM microscopes from many different vendors. In addition, the automatic feature finding and tracking functions will be accomplished using artificial intelligence directly in hardware and a novel scan pattern, completely different from current ?trace-retrace? scanning trajectory in current AFM. These new and ?smart? approaches further speed up scanning and tracking speed. Finally, the AFM will be able to produce nanomechanical images with high speed and accuracy using multifrequency spectroscopy. This concept has been proposed, and individual aspects have been demonstrated in isolation through simulations or lab prototypes over the past five years or more. The faster and more powerful electronic controller shall enable the test and implementation of multifrequency spectroscopy technology in its full potential."

The risk to develop DCS while conducting underwater activities occurs during the ascension phase, when the changing pressure may yield the formation of nitrogen bubbles in tissues and body. The presence of bubbles triggers a variety of serious injuries with long term consequences and even death. Any professional and licensed recreational scuba training makes trainees aware about the risks associated to DCS. Divers are instructed to follow ascent rates and safety stops according with criteria established from statistical considerations of empirical data. Nevertheless, DCS is suffered by rule-abiding divers during 3% of the immersions, requiring costly and distressing evacuation and treatment with hyperbaric chambers. The wearable device will alert the scuba-diver before the sickness develops, reducing the risk to suffer DCS, making underwater activities simpler and safer. The proposed project plans to demonstrate an innovative ultrasonic resonant concept adapted from the acoustic chamber notion. Acoustic chambers are structures which are belted by piezoelectric arrangements which are set to deform expanding and compressing when subjected to oscillating electric voltages. The frequency of oscillations can be set to match the modes of vibration of the media entering in resonance. Under such conditions the setup is extremely sensitive to minor changes in the elastic properties of the system, such as those induced by the presence of compressible bubbles. This project will execute a plan to produce a wearable design of the piezoelectric array. Artificial intelligence as well as conventional methods will be employed to analyze the electrical disturbances, and relate them to the bubbles sizes in real time. The computing, data acquisition and power requirements will be determined. Ultimately, these results will determine the feasibility to integrate all the required components in an autonomous wearable DCS risk detection device by a scuba diver."

The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer students' questions. It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe. It engages students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex. Besides school use, the game's independent learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model for the Company through school and commercial sales. The technology can also support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application for many other educational and training requirements. The innovation is a unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex. The platform combines video games, a complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt) that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions. The artificial intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures, exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle).

These tools allow others to understand how IVAs should be architected and integrate IVA technology into their offerings. IVAs have shown promise in numerous commercial domains including financial services, healthcare, education, law enforcement, and retail, to name a few, reducing the barrier to knowledge access within domains by providing a medium for people to converse naturally with sophisticated computer and information systems. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the significant technological challenges involved when scaling the domains and capabilities of an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA). This project will innovate in designing scalable artificial intelligence models capable of learning and identifying hundreds or thousands of learned concepts, and designing the accompanying system architecture to support the growing compute demand of sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, the project aims at achieving: (1) Scalable Intelligence: the ability to handle hundreds or thousands of competencies and extractable semantic concepts, allowing users to interact with the system with unbounded, unconstrained language; (2) Customizable Intelligence: the ability to allow customers to (semi-) automatically train and (re)train and customize the intelligence on demand (adding new competencies, identifying new slot-value pairs, modify responses); (3) Conversational Complexity: support multi-turn conversations, where the context from prior utterances is used to refine and understand what the end-user is trying to accomplish; and (4) Scalable System Infrastructure: enhance open source IVA software infrastructure to seamlessly scale up and down the computational resources allocated for each intelligence engine based on load."

An operational prototype was developed demonstrating how the Intelligent Information Processing System (IIPS) will operate in actual accidents/incidents.

For Phase II, we propose the following operating environment extensions from the flight deck environment: NextGen scenarios emphasizing interactions with air traffic controllers operating in fast paced, increased volume of manned and autonomous traffic; UAV operations emphasizing introduction of UAVs into the NAS, transition to autonomy and fully autonomous operations; and IIPS in flight training environments both simulated and airborne.  

We also propose an extension to the manner in which conditions were developed in Phase I.  Conditions were developed using post analysis of accidents and incidents.  The error chain of events was identified, information necessary to prevent the event was identified, and finally, a condition developed that detected the circumstances for a possible safety failure so that a notification could be transmitted to the actor who would then take the appropriate action to break the error chain.  This paradigm of condition development can be characterized as reactive.  With the NAS moving into a state of flux with the integration of UAVs and general increased traffic volume, reactive safety may not be acceptable.  In order to continue the steadily improving safety record of aviation, a more proactive approach must be considered.  We propose the use of a classical rule-based expert system and other artificial intelligence approaches that can make inferences of possible unsafe conditions using a temporal knowledge base populated by propositional statements generated by IIPS information sources."

Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults. The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team."

U.S. Department of Labor's recent survey reports that only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in science and engineering fields, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of the sustained economic expansion. Over the past few decades the U.S. contribution to the number of scientists and engineers worldwide has reduced from 40% to 15%. Interestingly, there is a high interest among young students for the STEM fields but approximately 40% of them end up switching to non-STEM careers by the time they graduate from college - according to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. This project brings a radical change in this trend by aptly stimulating the curiosity and challenging the intelligence, the key catalysts for continued interest, in K-12 students. Through innovative and intelligent hardware and software modules, this project delivers an enhanced learning experience on next generation robotics and automation technologies in the classroom as well as at home, leading towards a much richer and secure prospect for the future tax payers. This SBIR Phase I project develops an interactive and reconfigurable robotics-learning system comprised of smart positioning modules and interconnects. The key innovations include: a zero nuts-and-bolts architecture for quick and easy system setup, distributed artificial intelligence for interactive plug-n-play operations, and personalized gaming and learning feature to engage different age groups, experience levels, and study areas. This gaming and learning system aids in understanding various concepts of new age manufacturing, shaped by rapidly evolving economic constraints, including but not limited to: challenges in flexible/lean manufacturing for low cost and rapid turnaround production; effects of source agnostic automation, where robots/tools from different manufacturers are combined, on overall manufacturing metrics; and difficulties associated with robot cooperative control with limited feedback in complex operations. Such knowledge, gained through hands-on learning, better prepares the future scientists and engineers to not only adapt in the highly demanding manufacturing environment of the future but also explore innovative solutions to complex technical problems. This project envisions to significantly surpass the learning experience offered by contemporary educational toys, including passive building sets, jigsaw puzzles, rule-based interactive toys and so on, by delivering a highly immersed, actively encouraging, and truly exploratory experience for the makers of tomorrow."

The goal is to increase the interest in science for children in grades 5-8, where there is a shortage of science teachers, and where educational tools must compete with the high level of technology to which young people are attracted, like games with talking avatars and virtual personal assistants to answer their questions. Increasing students' interest in science careers can help fill the projected worker shortage for high tech industries and provide desperately needed science teachers.

This project will develop the initial offering in a projected series to facilitate independent learning of science, mathematics, engineering, history, the arts and other subjects through interesting stories and exciting virtual environments populated with XAs for the leaders in their fields. The project will build on the successful application in education of computer-based virtual environments and games by adding two important features. First, the digital content will be complemented by the book, whose characters use a fictional virtual environment to solve the same STARDUST MYSTERY posed in the game. What is STARDUST? Where, when and how did it form? How did it get into George Washington and from him to you? The book provides an introduction, user's guide, scaffolding and sales channel for the game. Second, the virtual environment and game, developed with Unity 3-D, will be populated by XAs for some of the great minds in science.

Large-scale on-line communities of educators will be able to create, customize, and share their own virtual role-play content, thus changing how people learn foreign languages. This will have a major impact on world language education and will help the US develop a more globally competent workforce. Many schools, especially in rural and underserved areas, have difficulty maintaining foreign language programs due to lack the resources to hire sufficient qualified teachers. This innovation will greatly increase the availability of high-quality interactive language learning resources that engage learners. These will be available online at little or no cost to schools. This could have a broad impact on world language enrollments as well as student retention in world language programs. In the longer term, virtual role-play can have a broad disruptive impact on training and workforce development. Employers are increasingly concerned about the skill gaps in the workforce, and communication and other 21st century skills are coming to the fore. This project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of a new tool and platform that enables non-programmers to create sophisticated virtual role-play simulations for learning foreign languages and other communicative skills. Competing can construct linear role-play scenarios, but are not suitable for creating interactive role-play simulations in which learners can take the initiative and where there are multiple possible outcomes. To break down the problem and make authoring feasible for teachers and students, the project will focus first on a significant, commonly occurring component of such dialogs, namely context-specific natural-language question-answering. The tool will automatically train a statistical language understanding system to recognize target questions so the virtual role-player can respond to them. This data-driven approach ensures that as users create content the body of training data continues to grow, making it ever easier to create new content. The toolset will help manage the necessary training data. The approach has the potential to change world language education from a teacher-led, classroom-centric activity to a personalized, learner-centric activity. It can flip the language classroom in ways that watching videos online cannot, by helping learners develop their conversational skills outside of class."

This project builds on the strong foundation of a one-of-a-kind, scientifically-grounded 90-minute 3D, interactive bullying prevention assembly for middle school students. The assembly is portable, easy to run and scalable, and evaluations demonstrated large immediate positive effects in students' desire to make changes to school climate and in their problem-solving skills, empathy, and confidence in handling bullying. This project addresses the challenge of ensuring that these immediate gains are translated into changes over time through the development of a novel app through community-based participatory research which combines empirically-based strategies with feedback from students, teachers, and administrators. This app will allow students to practice strategies learned from the assembly in a manner consistent with the growing demand for game-based mobile learning. Multiple teams will be hired throughout the US thus generating income for tax revenue and jobs. The high-risk, high reward technological innovation challenge in phase 1 is aimed to develop new technological platforms that will enable each user to build his own set of events from different scenarios, all through simple touch screen capabilities and build an artificial intelligence machine learning system that will understand the student's free language. In order to achieve this goal, the organization will work with a technological consultant and develop the content using scriptwriters, focus groups, and community-based participatory research. This will create the first student-driven, downloadable bullying prevention app for use in concert with a scientifically grounded bullying prevention show. The app will build upon the 90 minute multi-media show for 7th and 8th graders in which there is a powerful 3D narrative, video illustrations for how to deal successfully with bullying situations, and an audience interactive component through handheld voting devices. Together the show and app will positively impact a school's academic and social-emotional climate. In addition, the show and student-motivated app are significantly more feasible than the teacher time- and cost-intensive models of other bullying prevention programs."

This do-it-yourself-initially service will empower small-business enterprises with synthesized research of over 10 million patent documents within 10 minutes based on the concepts contained within the idea. Such a comprehensive, real-time, low-cost offering is currently unavailable for small-business entrepreneurs. Current search tools do not synthesize the results into an executive summary, do not allow an entire document to be entered as the search input, and do not perform real-time concept/correlation computations. This proposed innovation will enable the inventor to submit an entire document (the idea) as the search query; then, utilizing network mathematics and artificial-intelligence algorithms, this service will synthesize search results in real-time summarizing what patent documents are most related to the idea based on natural-language processing. Such a service for small-business entrepreneurs would enable them to initially ascertain the novelty of their idea and give them an on-the-go education about the natural language used in patent documents in comparison to their idea. This meta-innovation would objectively ascertain the intellectual-property merit of any proposed technology, enable small-business innovators, and foster the acceleration of innovation development in the United States. The development of latent semantic analysis (LSA) has enabled algorithm development to extract latent (or hidden) semantic structure from documents addressing two important word-sense ambiguity issues that text-matching search cannot: polysemy (single term with multiple meanings; i.e., strike as to hit [verb], to start up [verb], or to cease working [noun]) and synonymy (multiple terms with single meaning; i.e., car and automobile). Albeit robust, this concept-search approach for large document collections is not tractable due to the high-complexity computational requirements for performing matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) necessary for LSA. Approximation techniques that use subset approaches necessarily introduce some amount of systematic error. To ascertain the most relevant documents in a large collection for a given focal document, this proposed innovation (search-subset LSA) will subset using proprietary search methodologies without any systematic error, reducing both the number of documents to compare and the number of terms to analyze thereby making real-time document correlations possible. The aims of this research are: to identify the optimal subset approach for comprehensive nomological capture of top-correlation candidates, to ascertain optimal input parameters for the focal query document, and to develop a statistical test to confirm that no systematic bias is present in this approach."

The best pedagogies responsible for improving learning outcomes generally involve (i) constructed response assessments and (ii) one-to-one tutoring. Students learn the best when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words (instead of selecting from multiple choices) and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching in a one-to-one conversation with a human tutor. However, the costs and time associated with the constructed response assessment and one-to-one tutoring are significant, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subjects areas such as English language arts, STEM and humanities. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education on a large scale. This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting web based product will allow teachers to create new high quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase I research, a pilot study will be conducted involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and to verify its usability and feasibility."

As with all technology, wearable devices are increasing in popularity and decreasing in cost every day. Businesses rushing to catch this wave of technology paradigm are met with the complex problem of how to interpret the data gathered in a way that is accurate and useful to consumers. Many of these businesses are companies with products that were previously completely unrelated with computer or smartphone technologies. As such, they do not have the in-house expertise to not only correctly gather such data, but then analyze it for patterns that could be deemed useful in identifying behavior or conditions for the consumer. By providing a boxed solution that makes machine learning based data analysis possible for the average engineer, our project is aimed to help these businesses cross that hurdle. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project seeks to bring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems for use in the hands of non-data/computer scientists. While machine learning and AI techniques are widely used these days in many applications ranging from Google search to Uber rides, they remain fairly esoteric topics with a high learning curve just to understand, let alone apply. We plan to address this issue differently from previous competitors by building a highly intuitive web UI on top of our existing hardware sensor platform. This allows us to leverage the data gathering and processing consistency of our hardware, along with our proprietary SDKs to ensure properly labelled and clean data. As a result, we will have a much easier time developing basic digital processing filters as well as applying machine learning techniques to the data in order to solve generic classification problems."

We propose to build the Case Based Reasoning System for Software Architecture Evaluation and Insight (CBR Insight), to provide contracting officials with a tool they can use to measure and understand the ramifications of architectural complexity.CBR Insight will combine the functionality of a leading COTS static analysis tool with case based reasoning techniques from artificial intelligence and leverage existing visualization and automation software. The result is a tool capable of generating the propagation cost and core size metrics and fully leveraging these results to provide insight into operational performance, risks, and costs.During Phase I we will develop use cases and requirements, design the CBR Insight system, build a limited prototype, evaluate the prototype on open-source DOD projects, gather feedback, and develop a plan for Phase II.; BENEFIT: The most direct targets for marketing the results of this effort are contracting officials and others involved in government and commercial software acquisition. CBR Insight would be especially attractive to this market given that it is an analysis tool designed for non-developers. By demonstrating significant results in evaluating and understanding the ramifications of software architectural complexity in Phase II, CBR Insight will provide the US Air Force with a strong incentive to fund the Phase III deployment of the proposed system.A secondary target of this effort is to market CBR Insight as an extension to the existing COTS code analysis tool that CBR Insight will be integrated with.

By automatically integrating building information that is stored using various software applications and formats, this innovation enables owners and facilities managers to efficiently search for information and respond to emergency and failures, and proactively plan for operation and maintenance tasks. This innovation also applies artificial intelligence to automatically conduct big data analysis and identify opportunities to improve energy efficiency and operating performance of assets and indoor environment. Organizations can not only save operating budget by reducing equipment failures and energy waste, but also improve the quality of life and productivity for occupants. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at developing middleware technology to automatically integrate and analyze both structured and unstructured data from facilities design and operations. Facilities maintenance and operating is the longest phase in the life-cycle of buildings, accounting for more than 60% of the total cost of ownership. Owners and facilities managers are faced with the challenges of efficiently managing aging and crowded building infrastructure to extend the life of assets and control costs. However, fragmented and under-analyzed building information results in most maintenance work being conducted reactively to address problems that have already caused significant loss or waste. The vision of this innovation is to develop a fully commercialized software package to enable facilities managers to be more proactive in improving building occupant comfort, aligning limited resources where they have the most significant impact, and reducing wasted energy through optimized mechanical controls. This project aims to demonstrate the conceptual feasibility of using big data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize facilities operating and maintenance decisions.

Fatigue cracks worsen in severity throughout the life of the barrel until they reach a critical size, indicating end of life. During the Phase I effort, Luna demonstrated that eddy current (EC) techniques are effective in detecting both machined and fatigue-induced cracks inside gun barrels. EC-based measurements performed on several medium caliber barrels were not influenced by the intricate rifling profile of the bore of the barrel while remaining sensitive to cracks ranging from under 0.02 inches to greater than 0.375 inches. In the Phase II effort, Luna proposes development of an EC-based prototype with artificial intelligence post-processing algorithms for complete autonomy in assessing fatigue condition within barrels. A man-portable prototype for use on flight lines will be assembled, allowing for barrel evaluation without requiring their removal from the aircraft. Based on a multi-frequency excitation scheme, an improved design of the probes, and a trained neural classifier, the prototype will identify the number of existing cracks around the barrel circumference and assess their individual depths and locations.; BENEFIT: This project directly addresses the need for increasing savings and reducing maintenance cost of medium caliber gun barrels. Maintenance time and costs will be reduced by increasing barrel usage and reducing barrel replacement frequency. Currently, medium caliber gun barrels are retired when a maximum number of rounds is reached, often leading to premature removals. The developed system will allow for continued barrel usage throughout its entire useful life. The overall anticipated result of this effort is development of a new tool for assessing the condition of medium caliber gun inventory, replacing today’s statistically-based gun retirement protocol with a condition-based inventory management protocol. The proposed technology has broad market potential and meets a significant economic and national security need. Anticipated commercial uses include pipe inspection in the electric power, marine propulsion, and petrochemical industries."

Rigorous evaluations have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of teaching perspective-taking and social skills through simulated role-playing, beneficial to students struggling with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or bullying. These simulations will disrupt the multi-billion dollar market for social emotional learning (SEL) by allowing students to learn and practice social skills as they would with teachers or therapists, but at a fraction of the cost. Current solutions for practicing and assessing social skills rely on face-to-face interaction, which is costly and difficult to scale. Producing socially rich, open-ended simulations has previously been infeasible, due to technical challenges required to replicate the complexity of human language. This project overcomes these barriers using an innovative technology with the potential to revolutionize how people learn and practice social skills by delivering real-time personalized feedback at scale. Future applications of the social behavior capture (So-Cap) technology that underlies this project range from contextually aware intelligent personal assistants to socially aware robotics. This project's unprecedented ability to respond authentically to open-ended natural language input relies on an innovative crowdsourced approach to artificial intelligence (AI), which imbues machines with the ability to understand dialogue in context and engage in extended conversations covering multiple topics. Individualized responses are tailored to user input by drawing from a massive database of recorded human dialogue, captured from online role-playing. The process for mining meaningful patterns from this data also employs crowdsourcing, relying on non-experts hired online to cluster and annotate words, utterances, and events. A computational model formed by these patterns powers a real-time conversational engine, which selects responses by combining AI techniques including plan recognition and case-based planning.

Formative assessment (FA) practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services.

More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create significant commercial value within the educational market. This project will create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial, the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work, and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus software in the FA loop)."

The empirically tested model consists of three basic strategies and six practices that expand leaders' perspectives and enhance their problem-solving skills. The program uses a futuristic narrative, 3D-animated multimedia, and challenging leadership dilemmas to engage learners, who play the role of a novice world leader. The program provides instruction in leadership, and then learners apply their new leadership skills to build an alliance among warring factions and collectively solve a global problem. A series of game quests test learners' understanding, and they receive immediate feedback on all decisions and actions. Learners communicate through social media tools with other players and, at the end, participate in a virtual synchronous debriefing exercise with peers and trained facilitators to ensure full comprehension. An administrative dashboard provides real-time performance data. The game is scalable, accessible, and designed for repeat playability. The most profound innovation of this project is that it conceptualizes, designs, and develops a system of game mechanics and algorithms that mimic the facilitator-led human aspect of a research-based, face-to-face model of leadership training. This design entails building out a backend system as an artificial intelligence tool designed to guide users engaging with instructional materials, anticipate player actions, make recommendations on actions and anticipated actions, and provide feedback similar to guidance an on-site facilitator would provide. Furthermore, the game logic supports multiple paths to success, with some paths being more efficient, optimal, elegant, or otherwise more appropriate choices. The game logic and technical design are built to reflect problem solving and leadership in the real world, which is largely based on open-ended decision making. The game mechanics and related backend technology are designed to support open-ended decision-making, thus making game play both more engaging and authentic for players. A final innovation is the linking of an asynchronous online video game learning experience with virtual facilitator-led synchronous debriefing, which can be done on a worldwide scale. The program will be tested as a global collaboration exercise with both high school students and corporate leaders."

While research has shown that project-based learning is crucial for children to understand science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) topics, it currently requires knowledgeable facilitators providing guidance to be effective. This greatly limits the feasibility of project-based learning in schools, homes and informal learning environments. Augmented learning platforms hold the potential to change this, but are not widely deployed because they typically require expensive and unwieldy table top displays. The technology being developed in this project turns any mobile device into an augmented learning platform, transforming ordinary hands-on learning environments into interactive experiences by enhancing them with digital information. This project aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission to support science and engineering education at all levels by developing a novel educational platform that opens up STEM topics to all children, regardless of their prior experience or learning environment. The smart education and learning market is valued at $122 billion (2014), meaning that the commercial success of this U.S.-based company selling through U.S. schools and retailers will positively impact both domestic tax revenue and jobs. The augmented learning platform that will be developed in this project will enable project-based learning at an unprecedented scale. The platform will perform three tasks. It will employ computer vision to detect electronic circuits and convert them into a graph data structure. Then, it will use artificial intelligence and simulation to analyze the resulting graph data structure. Finally, it will provide feedback to users with an augmented reality overlay within a few milliseconds. The goal of the research is to develop and test this platform with the company's current users by integrating it into an electrical engineering tutor app and evaluating their engagement and learning outcome compared to pure hardware or software systems that teach engineering concepts. The system will initially be tested with data from automated mobile analytics tools from a wide-scale deployment to current users of the electrical engineering tutor app. In the future, the underlying technology can work with any subject that produces a graph data structure for analysis. The novel platform in this project enables every mobile device to be a learning platform, giving millions access to project-based learning."

Patients will be able to use the developed system to discover and compare the most suitable and experienced healthcare providers for their unique health needs, instead of just viewing a directory of providers in their area. For example, the proposed system will recommend to a patient searching for ""knee replacement surgery"" orthopedic surgeons with experience in this or similar procedures, positive health outcomes and high past patients satisfaction levels. The patient may then compare these surgeons by expertise, relative cost, location and several other attributes. By helping patients select the best healthcare providers, the proposed system not only has the potential to improve health outcomes, because providers will see the patients more relevant to their expertise, but may also reduce the number of ""shopping-around"" visits which may lead to a reduction in overall healthcare costs. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will study methods to exploit Big Data, ranging from government-published health metrics and surveys to public social media data, to better match patients to healthcare providers. A key challenge is that many of these sources include free text, which must be analyzed to extract medically significant information. Further, different sources refer to the same medical terms in different ways; for example ""myocardial infarction"" vs. ""heart attack"", or ""doctor knows her stuff"" vs. ""doctor is knowledgeable"". Data mining and artificial intelligence techniques will be leveraged to identify which provider properties - medical school, years of experience, affiliated hospitals, and so on - should be used when searching for providers and how these properties should be best weighted and combined, given the healthcare needs of a patient."

We aim to introduce to the hearing assistive device industry directional microphones with high
signal to noise ratio  and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of
acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip  We expect the technology to empower the
signal processing community with a new tool which  when used in conjunction with a
conventional omnidirectional microphone  will facilitate new features like ultra sharp
directionality adaptable in real time by the user and or artificial intelligence algorithms which
scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise  Directional sensing and the ability
to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing
impairments  Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds  while
the threshold of pain remains the same  As such  hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic
range or  window  of detectable sound amplitudes  Directional sensing enables preferentially
amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise 
As the first step  we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically 
inspired  rocking  style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated  robust
piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low power  small size  and high levels of
integration required of the hearing aid industry  Previous work in this field using laboratory
prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically inspired
sensing approach  i e  a simultaneous    dB SNR improvement and   x reduction size
improvement beyond what is achievable with present day hearing aid or MEMS microphones  
By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout  we aim to
accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing
device industry can be made  Further  the proposed readout is better adapted towards
integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip  We aim to integrate a microphone
with both in plane axis of directivity with an out of plane directional design to form a complete
  axis pressure gradient sensor Project Narrative
Studies show that today    of Americans wear a hearing aid  whereas at least     of
Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device  The major reason for this gap is
patient dissatisfaction  Hearing aid wearers suffer from what is known as the  cocktail party 
effect  When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you  noises in the
background are equally amplified   making every scenario sound like a cocktail party  This
research aims to make a positive  long term improvement to hearing aid patient satisfaction by
making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity"

Fatigue cracking is one of the most critical failure modes and can result in catastrophic barrel rupture if not detected and addressed. Currently, there is no existing NDI method or equipment to assess fatigue cracking within the barrel wall. Luna""s proposed technique has the advantage of automated inspection using compact and portable hardware that can deployed on a flight line without need to remove barrels from the aircraft. Present eddy current inspection techniques rely on highly trained personnel to visually inspect and interpret test data, with human error serving as the primary drawback in using eddy currents to inspect the health of tubes. The automation of eddy current analysis and flaw sizing is very important in this research effort. Luna""s proposed technique makes use of artificial intelligence to classify the eddy current signals and to recognize disruptive variables such as variation in microstructure (magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity), lift-off and edge effects, as well as the rifling signature itself.  The system will be designed to account for these variables and differentiate fatigue crack characteristics (fault length and depth) from false readings.  BENEFIT:  Luna""s goal for this project is to develop a portable inspection device that is suitable to inspect gun barrels on a flight line without need to remove them from the aircraft. The proposed work plan is focused on detecting cracks that grow radially outward into the barrel wall, providing an assessment of fault location, length, and depth. This technique is important to the military community, but is applicable to many other industries as well. For example, pipelines, pressure vessels, and steam generator tubes for power plants all contain critical modes of cracking such as fatigue cracking, fretting corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, or intergranular attacking on the outer surfaces of tubes. As design and analysis techniques evolve to incorporate fatigue crack detection, it is important to have measurement techniques capable of providing supporting data. The proposed technology expands the assessment of fatigue cracking capability to support these important challenges."

The goals of the Phase I research are to understand the OPIR tipping and cueing domain; elicit required planning knowledge related to follow-on sensor tasking from expert satellite image analysts; understand the resources, tasks, and constraints relating to the ISR scheduling problem; investigate integration requirements; define the appropriate performance metrics; elaborate the heuristics, algorithms, and techniques for improved OPIR tipping/cueing as well as to analyze them as to their feasibility in several dimensions and against the metrics; develop the Phase II system design; and further prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development and demonstrations in realistic scenarios. Stottler Henke has developed significant technologies and techniques for both the planning and scheduling parts of the problem AND we have teamed with actual analysts from BOTH the defense and intelligence communities who have extensive experience with the tipping and cueing process.BENEFIT:The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, this countrys ISR satellite system itself. The work is also applicable to other ISR assets such as UAVs. By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational systems, we will provide the DoD and intelligence communities with a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed PROACT. Beyond these there are several commercialization possibilities available in the Government and private sector. The algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force, Navy, and MDA sensor customers interested in sensor management. As mentioned in this proposal, commercial companies now offer satellite sensor services and these are potential targets as well. There are other commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler. We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains. The additional capabilities developed for OPIR tipping and cueing can be synergistically marketed to the same clients. For example, the bottleneck avoidance algorithm proposed as fully developed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers. We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

Most crucial to our work will be the design and development of a full infrastructure, called SERUM (Simulated training Exercises with Robust Unmanned Models) to support advanced AI for the USMCs simulation technology portfolio. This infrastructure will allow for robust, unmanned entities to exist in virtual simulation environments (e.g., VBS2), and will also include the necessary hooks and mechanisms to allow entities to both perceive the world and make actions within it.Using SERUM, developers and knowledge engineers can develop and integrate behaviors that drive SUDM characters within VBS2, thereby reducing the role player footprint required to support training. We anticipate that this resultant capability will provide significant flexibility for executing virtual and augmented-reality SUDM training by significantly reducing the constant requirement for manned role player support. Because the automated role players are driven by robust AI models and not scripts, training scenarios that use them can be much more dynamic and representative of the trainees operational responsibilities."

Through a browser or mobile app, participants enter a 3D virtual school environment where they play the roles of a bullying victim and bystander, and interact with characters controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). By walking in another&#039;s shoes, users take the perspective of others and empathize with them -- capacities proven to foster improved relationships. The effectiveness of the simulation lies in allowing users to interact in the virtual world as they would in their real-world school. Virtual characters respond authentically by drawing from a massive database of recorded human dialogue, providing individualized responses tailored to unique user input. The project makes three important intellectual merit contributions. In furthering computer science, it integrates advanced computing techniques -- AI, natural language processing, and crowdsourcing -- in a novel way. Second, it makes theoretical contributions to social science by enhancing understanding of how social psychology principles function in the virtual world. Third, in the field of analytics, software tools will mine patterns of communication strategies, generating knowledge about the impact of specific phrases on relationships. The broader/commercial impact of reducing bullying and improving relationships between children through unscripted, psychologically vivid, safely-controlled interactions in virtual environments is enormous. An extensive and deep body of research shows that bullying is pervasive in schools and has significant acute and chronic effects on learning and health outcomes. Despite the tremendous societal cost of bullying -- estimated around $25 billion -- and legal mandates to address the problem, a majority of schools do not have anti-bullying interventions in place. Existing interventions are expensive, difficult to implement, and focus on building awareness, rather than changing behaviors. This project will create a cost-effective and rapidly-scalable technology that mimics the complexities of human interaction to increase social perspective taking and empathy in children and adolescents. Dozens of middle and high schools have already agreed to implement the technology once developed. Improvement in student relationships and learning in these schools will be immediate. The technology developed has tremendous commercial potential for any training that relies on social and communication skills, such as corporate management, doctor-patient communication, autism therapy, and English language learning. Applications in these and other areas will generate dozens of new jobs for educators, engineers, developers, and data analysts."

In Phase I, we designed a backward-compatible Mesh Enhanced Tactical Airborne Link (METAL), and thoroughly analyzed the intrinsic tradeoffs arising from the partially upgraded network configuration. We also implemented and evaluated a prototype using IAIs RFnest wireless network emulation hardware and AGI toolkit.Beyond showing the potentially significant improvement in throughput and reliability provided by METAL, these early evaluations in a highly realistic network environment allowed us to identify and design several important enhancements to the topology management, resource allocation and routing functionalities. In Phase II, utilizing the key fundamental design guidelines established during Phase I, along with the additional knowledge regarding the legacy waveforms, we will implement several distributed mechanisms including topology formation, scheduling and routing optimization routines. We will also create a set of detailed, representative evaluation scenarios addressing various edge cases resulting from the heterogeneous network composition and verify the improved network performance benchmarks in two incremental development and evaluation spirals.BENEFIT:With many DOD aircraft aging and their service life extending, combined with downward budgetary pressure, there is a need to cost-effectively enhance existing tactical aircraft instead of developing entirely new tactical platforms.The proposed METAL system can be added as a software-only upgrade to various aircraft current using military communications waveforms (MADL, CDL etc.) such as the F-35.The METAL system will create a significant improvement over legacy systems by removing mission constraints and communication limitations artificially imposed by current waveform design.METAL will retain direct communication capability with legacy nodes.This approach improves network connectivity and performance, instead of causing increased isolation or requiring gateways.In the commercial sector, many point-to-point and spoke-and-hub waveforms are used for cellular communications, wireless data, and other consumer services.Due to increasing consumer data demands, there is a similar drive in the commercial world to improve the efficiency of these networks without requiring new hardware at either the consumer or carrier end.One possible application of METAL is to ease the deployment of microcells and femtocells, small-scale cell towers (e.g. a few hundred meters) that extend coverage and improve spectrum efficiency."

KSC&#039;s scheduling problem is decomposed into many individual but coordinated scheduling problems, each with its own unique set of resources, tasks, constraints, ground rules, and scheduling techniques, resulting in different scheduling processes for each of the individual applications. Stottler Henke&#039;s existing Aurora intelligent planning and scheduling system development framework was specifically designed for KSC ground operations scheduling and to be highly adaptable to different domains and has already proven to be adaptable by its successful applications in many dozens of widely varying domains (including multiple KSC scheduling domains). In every domain where a comparison was performed, Aurora always generated more optimal schedules.The proposed vision is to develop one scheduling tool that SMEs in wildly different KSC areas can adapt to create automated scheduling software for different scheduling applications. New capabilities need to be added to address the new KSC realities and to make the adaptation process more SME-friendly. Initially the Intelligent Operations Scheduling System (IOSS) would be fielded in a small number of vehicle and payload processing applications.  Later SMEs could adapt IOSS themselves. Eventually, IOSS-based automatic scheduling systems might constitute the majority of schedule decision making at KSC. These separate IOSS scheduling applications could automatically interact, providing automated coordination capabilities. These applications will also be able to interoperate with legacy scheduling systems. Ultimately, by automating, replacing, or interfacing to every scheduling function or system, extreme synergies of coordination and manpower savings would result."

In addition to improving learning outcomes for students, this project also includes support for mainstream teachers and teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs). To ensure the product is effective in real-world settings, ongoing formative evaluations with teachers/TVIs will be conducted and student outcomes will be measured during a year two field study. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the first-ever Braille education software based on AI, delivered on-demand through the Internet. The anticipated impact is that students achieve literacy and are able to perform at a higher level (e.g. academics, daily living, employment) resulting in improved quality of life and increased societal contributions. To have an impact, the product must be affordable, effective for a heterogeneous population in diverse learning environments, easy to use and easily accessed at convenient times and locations in informal and formal educational settings. In SBIR research supported by NIH, Quantum has successfully created the first-ever AI-based educational software that is accessible to the blind (in chemistry and mathematics).

The next logical step is to develop the full-scale family of SSN schedulers in our current Aurora framework and integrate them with the appropriate SSN systems.  These include the GIG-enabled Tasker Optimizing Scheduler and the scheduling portions of the Next Generation Tasker (NGT), including a LEO frequent revisit optimizing scheduler, a DS frequent revisit optimizing scheduler, and a Global Master Allocator Optimizing Scheduler.  This will require early, frequent, and long-lasting contact with the Next Generation Tasker (NGT) initiative led by the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/A9A, letter of support from Colonel Visel included) to ensure full understanding of the requirements, constraints, opportunities, and integration issues.  We also will provide advice and support to the NGT initiative from a resource optimization and scheduling perspective.      BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, the SSN itself including both the Next Generation Tasker (NGT) and the GIG-Enabled Tasker.  Attached is a letter of support from Colonel Visel which says, in part,""Our interactions have convinced us that there are several areas in our NGT effort that could benefit from Stottler Henke""s expertise.  Specifically, we see applicability for their Aurora tool to solve constrained scheduling problems in both frequent-revisit and catalog-maintenance sensor tasking.""By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed Schedulers.  Beyond the Air Force there are several commercialization possibilities available in the government and private sector.  The algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Army and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for SSN scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  For example, the bottleneck avoidance algorithm proposed to be fully developed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

This project will develop a web-based tutoring system to provide on-demand Braille literacy support to the visually impaired.

Project Activities: The main technological objectives include designing and implementing a user interface for dynamic Braille input and output, designing a rules-based expert system for the Braille curriculum, and designing a rules-based expert system to analyze student work and provide feedback. To assess implementation feasibility, the usability of the technology, and to gather data on the promise of the product to support student learning, a single-case pilot study will collect data from 50 students over 15 weeks.

Braille is the primary medium for written communication for the blind and there has been a dramatic decline in Braille literacy, negatively impacting academic performance, ability to navigate the everyday world and employment opportunities. The ability to bring proven effective AI technology to the table, will make a meaningful difference in providing equitable education opportunities to all students, as this project speaks directly to issues of basic literacy. Initially targeted for K-12 students, the majority of which are mainstreamed students served by the itinerant teacher of the visually impaired (TVI), the tutor will be web-based, enabling anyone to receive expert support on demand during study at school and home. Importantly, the tutor will operate using standard accessibility technology already in use. Because the tutor is supplemental to existing curricula and integrates directly with existing lessons, it will not require teachers/TVIs to change lessons, teaching materials, or schedules. In addition to improving learning outcomes for students, this project will also include support for teachers/TVIs responsible for instruction. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential for Braille education software based on artificial intelligence, delivered just-in-time through the Internet. The anticipated impact is that students achieve literacy and are able to perform at a higher level (e.g. academics, daily living, employment) resulting in improved quality of life and increased societal contributions. To have an impact, the product must be affordable, effective for a heterogeneous population in diverse learning environments, easy to use and easily accessed at convenient times and locations in informal and formal educational settings. In SBIR research supported by NIH, Quantum has successfully created AI-based educational software that is accessible to the blind (in chemistry). Furthermore, Quantum has successfully patented and commercialized unique AI technologies in chemistry and accounting using a business-to-business licensing model that provides educational companies with first-to-market and strong sustainable advantages. This model engages the entire spectrum of educational vendors, offering breakthrough technology that permits increased market share for customers and rapid dissemination to end users. For this project, Quantum will partner with organizations with established channels, who distribute the software as an online service, such as the American Printing House for the Blind, a partner on this project."

Complex, distributed airspace simulations that utilize experimental testbeds (e.g., Multi Aircraft Control System, or MACS) are vital research tools for these projects. However, managing the various complexities and coordination of agent-supported separation assurance can be challenging. This often creates undesired staffing and training requirements, workload, and susceptibility to human error that can disrupt planned scenario events. To address this issue, we propose to develop Artificial Intelligence for Refining Multi-Aircraft Testbed Environments (AIR-MATE). This proposed innovation will provide a MACS-interoperable software module that coordinates the behaviors of human-automation pairs in simulated NextGen airspace. This effort will leverage recent advancements in distributed constraints optimization and adjustable autonomy to analyze airspace simulations in a decentralized, parallel manner and solve problems locally for enhanced efficiency. This technology will reduce the workload and staffing requirements in current NextGen simulations, while ensuring the desired scenario events and separation assurance is properly executed. The results of the AIR-MATE effort will be a more controlled and high-fidelity testbed environment that will aid researchers, increase the quality of NextGen research, and ultimately benefit the development of NextGen concepts."

At the same time, the general state of world affairs is changing such that the likelihood and impact of UAV’s in operations is greater than ever before.  Thus, the ability to use effective computer modeling and analysis tools in decision-making at all levels is more critical than ever, especially in the development of UAV doctrine, tactics, procurement, design, and integration into force structures and missions.

We will investigate a novel combination of sparse image representation, feature matching algorithm, and geometric verification in order to advance the performance of 3D object matching. While state-of-the-art image intelligence is robust enough to enable rapid and accurate image search of flat feature-rich objects, current computer vision pales in comparison to the abilities of biological vision systems to recognize 3-dimensional objects. Our underlying goal is to bring inspiration from recent advances in theoretical neuroscience and apply them to image and video search solutions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Mobile visual search, using a cell phone camera to retrieve object information, enables a mobile phone camera to become an artificial 'eye' with object recognition intelligence. Implemented on a cell phone, a mobile visual search tool can be a low cost visual aid for the blind."

High fidelity, historically calibrated wargames ranging from sub-tactical ground-centric game engines through operational, strategic, air campaign, and naval-centric game engines will be used to address the full spectrum of UAVs, their capabilities, and optimal use.  These computer wargames all come with a powerful and highly adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability developed over several years of research and development which allows these wargames to be effectively used in both human-interaction and fully-automated settings.  Employing these wargames with this AI feature allows for execution on both interactive and multi-processor computer systems as appropriate for the research being conducted.  BENEFIT:  UAVs have been a very significant military development recently and are poised to significantly impact all combat scenarios from the very tactical to the strategic in all areas of warfare: ground, air, and naval.  As the capabilities of UAVs increases, it is important to anticipate and optimally implement them into combat scenarios.  High-fidelity computer wargames together with powerful and highly adaptive AI functionality can be effectively and efficiently used to pursue research into the use of UAVs.  It is important that these wargames be effectively calibrated so that any results obtained from them can be viewed with a high level of confidence that they are representative of actual situations.  Likewise, it is important that these wargames have both interactive and automated execution modes so that investigations can be carried out both with human-in-the-loop and on high-performance computer systems.  The interactive mode supports discoveries of the use of UAVs that might not be realized and understood while the automated modes supports mathematical optimization of their use."

The EFFECT system integrates advanced optics, artificial intelligence, and automated cleaning and debris removal (solvent delivery, debris vacuum, and inert nitrogen gas drying) with a novel adaptor system to accommodate virtually all form factors of fiber optic interconnects.  Body-worn solvent and inert gas reservoirs, a vacuum system, and battery packs allow for operation in tight, confined spaces where aircraft/vessel power is not readily available and the use of innovative quick-connect adaptors (QCAs) affords the ability to effectively restore functionality in under 1 minute to the various interconnect architectures exposed to contaminants when removing line-replaceable units (LRUs).  In Phase I, POC will define the variables for inspecting and cleaning fiber optic interconnects and fabricate a technology readiness level (TRL)-3 prototype.  In Phase II, a rugged prototype will be demonstrated to show its feasibility to perform terminus endface restoration in realistic military avionics connector environments at TRL-5.  BENEFIT:  The use of fiber optics for data transmission has tremendous applications in both military and commercial environments.  With its many benefits over standard coaxial and copper lines, the use of optical transmission is growing exponentially, particularly in the telecommunication industry, which has invested a considerable amount of money in providing infrastructure directly to consumer households.  Unfortunately the fragility and susceptibility to signal degradation requires continued maintenance that can be time consuming without proper equipment.  EFFECT will greatly help reduce this maintenance burden with an effective system that is efficient and intuitively operated with negligible infrastructure needs."

This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for  teaching tools  and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for  other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision.  The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology.

QuickMANet uses distributed, cooperating management nodes in the virtual hierarchy that enables a global fault status perspective even on very large wireless ad hoc networks, including those with mobile elements. The system relies on real-time network modeling of potential faults as fault signatures are observed in the operating network. The modeling helps to define the search space relevant to a particular observed signature, and this information is then used to drive an artificial intelligence-based diagnosis and self-healing response capability.

Typically though, algorithms have been narrowly applied to solve niche issues within broader JOPP/JAEP tasks. The concept of hybrid architectures seeks to provide a more holistic approach. With hybrid architectures, tasks are decomposed into subtasks that are assigned an algorithm suitable to performing that subtask. Hybrid architectures may be constructed from a variety of algorithms, and typically multiple algorithms can be applied to a general classification of problem. However, although the classification may be similar, the problem constraints imposed by the current situation in which decisions must be made vary greatly. To address these challenges, Securboration is teaming with artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eugene Santos from Dartmouth College to develop the Virtual Hybrid Architecture Computing System or VHACS. In Phase I of this effort, the Securboration Team will develop the VHACS prototype that determines appropriate algorithms to satisfy given subtasks within the current operational environment and then composes them into a specification that it invokes for a distributed execution. VHACS combines the benefits of traditional hybrid architectures with the reach, flexibility, and reusability of netcentric concepts.  BENEFIT:  VHACS presents a series of interesting initial commercialization opportunities that will be explored, and subsequently refined, over the course of this research. The approaches taken in VHACS to automate hybrid execution through distributed discovery and composition and applying the results to solve complex problems have utility to a variety of commercial applications. The four most prominent include: 1) Logistics – algorithms that focus on optimization can be combined with other algorithms to understand the propagating cascading effects that logistics contributes to, 2) Gaming – algorithms and techniques developed for VHACS can be embedded into gaming engines (including military) to incorporate a more dynamic/realistic behavior based on ‘composite’ algorithms. Especially with distributed gaming approaches, VHACS can dynamically alter the algorithms that comprise the executable hybrid architecture package to modify the behavior of virtual entities etc., 3) World Banking – VHACS can invoke hybrid algorithms to understand how regional behaviors rapidly change based on perceptions of U.S. actions taken, VHACS could be used to understand regional stability issues that are of great concern to the world banking community, 4) Strategic Business Analysis –there is a very close analogy between understanding an enemy, his likely courses of action and developing a plan to defeat him to that of understanding a business competitor, his likely aggressive business actions and developing a strategic business plan to dominate in a discrete business domain. It is clear that this research could significantly improve, or perhaps even supplant, current business analysis and planning techniques such as SWOT analysis."

Ideally the camera would have a suitable means for blocking solar stray light and glints, and it would not have any moving parts.  The baseline camera must be versatile enough to transition to other satellites for a variety of purposes.  The following applications would be ideally suited for this type of camera system:  star tracker navigation, satellite near field monitoring for docking and refueling, space debris tracking, intelligence gathering.     The Spectral Imaging Laboratory proposes the development of a high definition artificial compound eye (ACE) derived from natural arthropod compound eyes.  Arthropod compound eyes can acquire wide angle images with zero distortion and an infinite depth of field (all objects are in focus at all ranges).  Video cameras with these characteristics would benefit by eliminating the need for gimbals and focus mechanisms, thereby reducing volume, mass, and potential failure points.     The high definition ACE relies on curved (3D) glass lens arrays.  The purpose of this project is to develop the ability to mold 3D glass lens arrays with sufficiently high surface quality to enable high resolution imaging.  BENEFIT:  This research will result in the ability to mold high quality 3D double sided lens arrays suitable for high resolution imaging.  This capability will enable the development of a distortion free, high definition panoramic camera that does not require focus adjustment.  The optics fabrication is based on a hot press molded, curved lens array technology that is ideally suited for low cost, high volume production.  The principal application is a new type of star tracker that can view to within 5 degrees of the sun.  Other commercial applications include robotic and autonomous wide area surveillance.  Robots will benefit from the wide field of view, infinite depth of field attribute by using it to navigate more reliably through rugged terrain.  The optics will enable real time navigation for autonomous flying robots that use the optical flow field to navigate.  Robots designed to grasp objects will benefit from being able to view objects in focus at every distance."

Ancillary benefits include reduced fuel consumption for improved range of operation and the reduction of wake signature.  The objective of this research project is to continue the successful development of ride control systems for high speed combatant craft with the goals of improving motion-reducing performance  through the use of not-currently-implemented predictive features that rely on data from additional on-board sensors and real time sea condition models, and additional not-currently-implemented system automation to reduce operator task load. BENEFITS: Ride control systems are well-proven in commercial and military applications.  The company proposing this work has successfully fielded ride control systems for relatively small, very high speed combatant craft with impressive results.  For example, one application reduced the peak motions-induced shock acceleration on a 11m US Navy RHIB by approximately 50% (from over 12 g’s to less than 6 g’s), and the company’s ride control system is currently being fitted to every new UK MOD high speed special operations craft.  It is believed that further sea-induced motion reductions, with commensurate reductions of injury-causing acceleration can be achieved by (a) using data from additional on-board sensors such as radar or radio-frequency wave height telemetry and (b) using data from sea condition models that are updated in real-time by the ride control system embedded controller.  Neither approach is currently implemented anywhere in the world as a control input to the ride control system, and mathematical models and control algorithms must be developed to achieve the goal of improved performance.  The anticipated benefits of a system employing these features is improved system performance with little increase in system price, which is an aspect that is very important for follow-on commercial applications.  That is, excluding the one-time cost of developing models and algorithms, taking input from craft radar or radio-frequency wave height telemetry is merely a systems integration issue rather than additional hardware scope of supply requirement because the candidate craft, whether military or commercial, are always fitted with radar units, and current generation ride control systems are always fitted with conventional motion sensors such as accelerometers, rate gyros, and inclinometers.  Further, it is believed that current-generation embedded processors with adequate computational power are commercially available to simultaneously update sea condition models in real time and run the ride control system algorithms in real time. Another aspect of the work being proposed is increased automation to reduce operator task load.  Most current generation ride control systems require the operator to change system settings in response to prevailing sea conditions.  Some current generation ride control systems have adaptive algorithms, which merely use a gain scheduling approach that is crude and ineffective for high speed craft.  The company proposing this work has investigated integration of an artificial intelligence engine into the ride control system, but performance models indicate that the “learning time” is too long for high speed craft operating in confused sea conditions.  However, taking data from additional on-board sensors, such as radar or radio-frequency wave-height telemetry, would decrease “learning time” and provide better motions-reducing performance without the operator having to manually change system settings.  As above, the anticipated benefits of a system employing this feature is improved system performance with little increase in system price, which is an aspect that is very important for follow-on commercial applications.  That is, excluding the one-time cost of developing models and algorithms, taking input from craft radar is merely a systems integration issue rather than additional hardware scope of supply requirement."

This device is relatively easy to use and enables most laryngectomees to verbally communicate, but with reduced intelligibility and markedly degraded naturalness. In addition, EL speech is often described as robotic and monotone, attributable largely to the lack of normal fundamental frequency (F0) variation/control, abnormal voice source timing (e.g. voice onset and offset controlled by a thumb button) and abnormal spectral characteristics (e.g., reduced energy below 500 Hz). Previous research has demonstrated that neck surface electromyographic (EMG) signals can serve as an intuitive and effective control source for EL voice onset/offset timing and F0 modulation. The goal of this project is to develop an effective, practical, and user-friendly EMG-EL that can provide improved control over voice source timing and F0 for more intelligible and natural-sounding EL speech.  The Phase I specific aims are 1) Produce a prototype wireless EMG sensor appropriate for EL control; 2) Integrate wireless EMG signal reception and processing circuitry into a hand-held EL; and 3) Evaluate the prototype EMG-EL through testing with laryngectomy patients experienced in EL use.  Assuming successful prototype development in Phase I, work in Phase II will further refine the EMG-EL by 1) Optimizing the control scheme of F0 and onset/offset from neck surface EMG signals; 2) Determining which device parameters are appropriate for user adjustment which should be set by the clinician guiding speech rehabilitation; and 3) conducting extensive user testing of the device with iterative adjustment of its form and function based on user performance and structured feedback.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common voice prosthesis used after total laryngectomy is the hand-held buzzer or electrolarynx (EL), but EL speech typically lacks pitch variation and precise timing control, giving it a highly unnatural sound quality with reduced intelligibility. Previous research has shown that pitch variation can significantly improve EL speech, and that neck muscle electromyographic (EMG) signals can be used as an intuitive control source for controlling EL vocal intonation and timing (onset/offset). The objective of this project is to develop and test an EMG-controlled EL that can be offered commercially to improve the communication and therefore lives of thousands of EL users."

The ultimate system should outperform the existing software and human schedulers including better quality schedules; faster scheduling; handling larger, more complex sets of requests; and handling additional communication system capabilities, including multi-beam phased array antennas.  The developed system should show superior performance on AFSCN/GDPAA scheduling/route planning problems, and demonstrate significant benefit for human future AFSCN schedulers.  Each of the algorithms should be rigorously analyzed and have its most relevant properties proven, such as correctness, termination, and required conditions.  Integration requirements with ESD will be investigated.  The information content and timing between the MLM and the GDPAA managers will be determined.    BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, scheduling for the future AFSCN which will include GDPAAs and the other Space Communication Networks (DSN, GN, and SN).  By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed MLM.  Beyond the Air Force and NASA there are several commercialization possibilities available in the government and private sector.  Additionally, there are many similarities between communication scheduling and sensor scheduling.  Thus the algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for communication scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

This SBIR project will investigate, develop, and deploy a web-based software system (called PolARES) that supports key decisions for crisis management and battlefield applications.  This system will produce a revolutionary improvement in decision performance for both experienced and novice decision makers. Successful crisis decision-making employs a psychology termed recognition-primed decision-making, a method that uses limited event observations to force quick recognition of an analogous scenario from a knowledge base.  The PolARES decision system will support rapid decision-making in battlefield, emergency, and disaster situations. PolARES will include an extensive relational database of decision scenarios: event/decision pairs tailored to a target decision maker and decision space. PolARES will employ an advanced artificial intelligence algorithm to lead the decision maker through a limited set of questions to a rapid choice of a stored scenario. The tool will then adapt the base scenario to actual event conditions.  A feasibility prototype demonstrated PolARES’ potential for chemical emergency response in Phase I of this SBIR.  In Phase 2, PolARES will be applied to tactical military decision-making and other crisis decision environments."

Readily available contact with the deployed parent could reduce stress on the child. That reduction could in turn improve the service member’s resiliency by reducing family stress. Artificial intelligence and game technologies can be applied to support virtual interactions when the parent is not available, but several key challenges must be overcome to attain a workable solution. For the child, the system must be comforting, easy to use, and engaging, while avoiding any possible psychological harm.

To address these challenges, we propose to design a Virtual Interactive Parent (VIP) System for providing on-demand synthetic parent interactions to comfort left-behind family members—particularly young children—during stressful periods. VIP focuses on three components: 1) an Interaction Template Library of familiar, comforting interaction “scenes” that parents fill with personalized content; 2) a VIP Application for the child to communicate and play within these “scenes”; and 3) Secure Content Management Tools supporting parents as they personalize content and enjoy the child’s interaction with that content."

In the United States alone, approximately 1,500 people die each year after swallowing foreign bodies, with children accounting for about 80% of foreign body ingestions. Other groups at increased risk include prisoners, psychiatric patients, and the elderly, especially those who have decreased cognitive function, impaired swallowing after a stroke, or poorly fitting dentures. Rigid and flexible endoscopy, with accessories such as various forceps and snares, is the most common technique for removing these impacted esophageal foreign bodies. Lack of reliability and flexibility of grasping tools, however, make the procedure time-consuming and risky. Often bolus and foreign body removal procedures lead to more invasive surgical procedures and even death, an especially tragic result for a child who has swallowed a coin or battery, the most common event in pediatric cases of obstruction. It is also the most difficult scenario because the contracted esophagus holds the object with substantial force. Power needs to be applied to the prongs of the forceps to overcome these forces; no current technology provides this force. Lack of a secure hold on the object as it is being removed and as the esophagus relaxes often causes the object to go into the trachea, resulting in death. Therefore, physicians involved in these procedures need a tool that can mimic human fingers, which provide maximum articulation. To address these needs, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a new device for ingested foreign body removal, specifically focusing on the withdrawal of the most difficult and least successful procedures, such as coins and button batteries. Based on the highly successful Phase I results of IOS' Artificial Hand (AH), Phase II research will focus on developing, engineering, and testing a novel endoscope with unique distal end tips attachments that will secure the object, allowing its complete and safe removal from the patient. One attachment, the AH's Seeing Fingers, will use a pair of strong pneumatically controlled fingers that will deliver and secure a net around the object. Another attachment, the AH's Seeing Grabber, will use 2 two- or three-finger hands, and will provide distraction and removal of bolus. All Seeing Fingers and Seeing Grabber fingers will have autonomous illumination and visualization channels. IOS will develop the AH's Seeing Fingers and Seeing Grabber in stages. The MEMS microfabrication lab at University of California, Los Angeles, IOS's collaborator, will help to develop the fingers; the optical channels and controls will be developed at IOS. After completion of this step, IOS will assemble the distal manipulating parts, generate the manipulation protocol, evaluate the procedure, and make improvements in the benchtop experiments. The Seeing Grabber prototype will then be fabricated and tested. Finally, the Seeing Fingers will be designed, fabricated, tested, and presented to a potential strategic partner. IOS' proposed Seeing Fingers and Seeing Grabber system will be a vast improvement over existing tools, providing a life-saving tool for physicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ingestion of foreign bodies is a common problem worldwide, especially in the pediatric population, where more than 100,000 cases occur each year. The endoscopic technique, currently the gold standard for removing ingested foreign bodies, is inefficient and unsafe, often resulting in death. A safer device, IOS' Artificial Hand's Seeing Fingers, employs two hands with fingers and secures the trapped object, allowing safer removal than is currently available and saving many lives."

The Virtual Iconic Presence can be tailored by software and training to represent a wide range of religious, cultural and ethnographic qualities, creating interactive “Icons” with personality, mannerisms and attributes associated with geographic regions, political movements or ethnic populations. This combines techniques from  animation, voice recognition, AI, and real time video graphics to create an interactive artificially intelligent virtual presence to support training and mission rehearsal/experimentation areas within the DoD. Tailoring features and speech makes our solution applicable to both training and delivering a message. This same technology could be used for educational purposes.

This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for  teaching tools  and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for  other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision.  The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology. Vertical Expansion of Accessible Features and Technological Capability 5) Implement Braille support in AI technology. 6) Develop additional AI tutor on Fractions that is automatically accessible from first principles using accessible AI framework. Evaluation of Accessible AI Educational Technology 7) Field evaluation of accessible AI technology with blind students and their instructors. 8) Continued demonstration and review of accessible AI technology by partners and other stakeholders. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum already has long-term partnerships established with McGraw- Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as a major science education catalog company, CyberEd, Inc., a PLATO Learning Company. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a considerable need for improved educational software for mathematics in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind and visually impaired is particularly acute. A weak mathematics background can cause unnecessary limitations in daily living activities and seriously hinder or even preclude effective pursuit of more advanced mathematics education and careers in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Through previous federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for developmental mathematics. The goal of this Fast-Track project is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired."

An innovative effort to design, develop and demonstrate Multi-Modal Interfaces for Synthetic Training Environments for effective training.  The system will allow live humans as team or squad leaders to utilize a suite of interface devices to control and interact with automated forces and the simulation environment.   It is well known that small teams of dismounts often use non-verbal communications to direct subordinates.  These “gestures” may also be repeated to by sub-commanders to other team members.  Similarly, non-verbal responses may be used providing full 2-way communication of key tactical methods and status within the team.  Current semi-automated force (SAF) applications do not include non-verbal communication capabilities and often have limited or poor world response and interaction capabilities.   World interaction includes any number of items such as the ability to “use” a light switch or recognize potential danger indicated by an opened door or broken window. The proposed concept addresses the limitations of current systems artificial intelligence (AI) and input devices available for humans-in-the-loop.

Typically though, algorithms have been narrowly applied to solve niche issues within broader JOPP/JAEP tasks. The concept of hybrid architectures seeks to provide a more holistic approach. With hybrid architectures, tasks are decomposed into subtasks that are assigned an algorithm suitable to performing that subtask. Hybrid architectures may be constructed from a variety of algorithms, and typically multiple algorithms can be applied to a general classification of problem. However, although the classification may be similar, the problem constraints imposed by the current situation in which decisions must be made vary greatly. To address these challenges, Securboration is teaming with artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eugene Santos from Dartmouth College to develop the Virtual Hybrid Architecture Computing System or VHACS. In Phase I of this effort, the Securboration Team will develop the VHACS prototype that determines appropriate algorithms to satisfy given subtasks within the current operational environment and then composes them into a specification that it invokes for a distributed execution. VHACS combines the benefits of traditional hybrid architectures with the reach, flexibility, and reusability of netcentric concepts.  BENEFIT: VHACS presents a series of interesting initial commercialization opportunities that will be explored, and subsequently refined, over the course of this research.  The approaches taken in VHACS to automate hybrid execution through distributed discovery and composition and applying the results to solve complex problems have utility to a variety of commercial applications. The four most prominent include: 1) Logistics algorithms that focus on optimization can be combined with other algorithms to understand the propagating cascading effects that logistics contributes to, 2) Gaming algorithms and techniques developed for VHACS can be embedded into gaming engines (including military) to incorporate a more dynamic/realistic behavior based on composite algorithms. Especially with distributed gaming approaches, VHACS can dynamically alter the algorithms that comprise the executable hybrid architecture package to modify the behavior of virtual entities etc., 3) World Banking VHACS can invoke hybrid algorithms to understand how regional behaviors rapidly change based on perceptions of U.S. actions taken, VHACS could be used to understand regional stability issues that are of great concern to the world banking community, 4) Strategic Business Analysis there is a very close analogy between understanding an enemy, his likely courses of action and developing a plan to defeat him to that of understanding a business competitor, his likely aggressive business actions and developing a strategic business plan to dominate in a discrete business domain. It is clear that this research could significantly improve, or perhaps even supplant, current business analysis and planning techniques such as SWOT analysis."

For automatic mine detection in underwater sonar applications, research has indicated that the identifying the context of the scene will improve the recognition performance. Further, there is a need to constantly update and modify the representative knowledge base with information from new target and background samples. Based on advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence and their sophisticated applications to intelligent imaging solutions, we propose an Incremental Knowledge Assimilator that can identify the environmental context in the scene and optimally incorporates new and relevant data samples into the knowledge base (classifier) in an incremental fashion with minimal memory and computation requirements. The incremental learning algorithm is designed to facilitate concept drift. Since the goal of the system is to learn perpetually, it lays higher stress on learning the patterns the each mode of the distribution (or each class) rather than focusing merely on the separation of classes.

Here, we propose a system of Arbitrage Look-ahead Agents for Market-based Optimization (ALAMO) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. This negotiation mechanism and the agents’ bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. We extend market-based optimization using arbitrage look-ahead agents to turn this approach into a non-myopic planning algorithm, which provides computational gains, more efficient allocations of sensor tasks, and risk management framework that hedges against uncertainty."

Cooperative decision making and problem solving is hard for people who have different languages, priorities, and incentives, and is even more difficult with the participation of non-human agents with inscrutable behaviors to people. A fundamental challenge is in developing artificial agents that collaborate in a natural way with humans in order to utilize individual expertise to benefit the whole. Our innovation is a shared intelligence framework, a constrained, but still widely-applicable, role of human agent collaboration (HAC), for managing human-agent teams and ultimately facilitating both human-agent cooperative tasks and human-to-human activity coordination. Our approach addresses the overall problem of cooperative intelligent behavior by splitting it into two sections, where collaborative decision-making falls on the shoulders of human experts who work together (possibly through agent intermediaries), but where the generation and flexible adaptation of the expert team is conducted through HAC."

The proposed innovation is a teacher professional development system built on the principles of artificial intelligence, and delivered via the Internet. Similar to a flight simulator, this technology will offer a realistic but benign opportunity to test and expand a teacher's preparedness through practice with realistic classroom situations. A key objective is the creation of a classroom simulator which incorporates a virtual master teacher, to help teachers deepen their content understanding, learn to respond to student questions more effectively, practice proven pedagogical techniques for improving student understanding and conduct self-monitoring and assessment before getting in front of a live class.  An increasing number of schools are forced to rely on new or out-of-field teachers to fill the gap for teaching science and mathematics, often resulting in a substantial decline in quality, depth and individual attention students receive. Because of the well-documented problems of teachers teaching out of their content areas, and low-performing schools having greater percentages of lesser-qualified teachers, states have established stronger criteria for in-service teachers and newly qualifying pre-service teachers. Middle and high school
science and mathematics are the areas where most out-of-area teaching is occurring. In the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) report, 'The Condition of Education', a key finding is that high school students in high-poverty, high-minority schools were more often taught science, mathematics and English courses by out-of-field teachers than their peers in low-poverty, low-minority schools. This research is expected to impact these issues and in addition address the goals of the American Competitiveness Initiative and the requirements for highly qualified teachers identified in the 'No Child Left Behind' initiative."

Such a device extends the lifetimes of diode lasers by shutting off the supply current when formation of a potentially damaging current filament appears likely. This allows the diode to return to its initial state with no memory of filamentation. We have artificially generated optical transients by applying current pulses atop the normal, regulated drive currents of laser diodes to observe the result of such aberrant behavior of the laser’s properties and lifetime. We have studied the optical and electrical behavior to correlate excursions in both that indicate performance-degrading faults. The plan is to use such optical transients as predictors of potentially damaging faults, and to use this to trigger a protection circuit that will shut down the drive current for a short time and allow the diode to return to a safe state before resuming operation. The optically-triggered protection circuit combined with a constant current supply will then be tested on LDAs to demonstrate that it increases the working lifetime of off-the-shelf laser diodes."

Specifically, tactical target recognition in air-to-ground infrared imagery will increase the lethality of precision guided missiles and reduce fratricide. However, recognition is difficult when the variations in atmospheric conditions and background cause the clutter/target models to behave significantly different from their statistical patterns. Thus, there is a need to constantly update and modify the representative knowledge base with information from new target and clutter samples while retaining non-redundant information. Based on advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence and their sophisticated applications to intelligent imaging solutions, we propose an Incremental Knowledge Assimilation system to optimally incorporate new and relevant data samples into the knowledge base (adaptive bagging based decision forest classifier) in an incremental fashion with minimal memory and computation requirements. Since the goal of the system is to learn perpetually, it lays higher stress on learning the patterns the each mode of the distribution (or each class) rather than focusing merely on the separation of classes. We present preliminary performance results to validate our methodology."

The first objective will be to remove distortions and mechanical sounding expressions. Observations suggest that the distortions arise from the lack of logical insertion of pauses (i.e., based on a model of real speech) between elements in the synthetic speech stream. This objective will be accomplished by developing an algorithm based on recordings of math educators speaking mathematical expressions that will be incorporated into the synthetic speech conversion mechanism. The second objective will involve efficacy testing for the reduction of distortions and mechanical sounding expressions. Distortion reduction testing will require participants to listen expressions and to exactly (verbatim) report the expressions they heard. The third objective will involve an efficacy test to test the capacity of the pause algorithm to
enhance disambiguation.Broader impacts include the following: an overriding goal is to increase the accessibility to science, technology, engineering, and mathematical fields by under-represented groups. This goal is consistent with the objectives of the NSF and the Department of Educations incentive to further develop and implement the National Instructional Accessibility Standard (NIMAS), which would facilitate an increase in accessibility via the development of flexible alternatives to print as a primary objective. Additionally, the project advances discovery and understanding not only of the specifics aspects of the wording of spoken language that contribute to misinterpretations but also investigates the more subtle nuances of the non-verbal information such as the intervals between word and their influences on accurate acquisition of information. These findings have educational implications for the optimization of learning strategies and models for teaching and training. Further, the basic protocol for algorithm development has potential paradigmatic significance for development and improvement of synthetic speech across multiple fields that synthetic speech such as artificial intelligence, augmentative and alternative communication, and computer and communication sciences."

In the United States alone, approximately 1,500 people die each year after swallowing foreign bodies, with children accounting for about 80% of foreign body ingestions. Other groups, who are at increased risk, include prisoners, psychiatric patients, and the elderly, especially those who have decreased cognitive function, impaired swallowing after a stroke, or poorly fitting dentures. Food bolus impaction also occurs frequently in animals. Rigid and flexible endoscopy, with the respective accessories, such as forceps of different types and snares, is the most commonly used technique for the active management of impacted esophageal foreign bodies. The lack of reliability and flexibility of the tools used for grasping and holding the object make the procedure time consuming and risky, and in many unsuccessful situations, leads to the necessity for performing a more invasive surgical procedure. The development of a flexible, safe tool that can, ideally, mimic human fingers (there is nothing more articulating than the human hand) is the dream of physicians involved in these procedures. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a unique device for ingested foreign body removal. The device will utilize a pair of four-finger artificial hands, and will have internal illumination and visualization channels, in the distal end of the device. The ""Artificial Hand,"" which evolved from initial studies at UCLA, is a four-finger pneumatically controlled manipulator. Silicon micromachining is used to fabricate multiple phalanges per finger, allowing the entire closed ""fist"" to fit into a one-millimeter diameter tube. The hand will be scaled to provide the force necessary to remove foreign bodies, and fiber optic illumination will be embedded in the ""palm"" of the hand. The hands will be incorporated into a flexible shaft, along with a visualization channel and an articulating tip similar to a conventional endoscope. Such a device will be superior to existing techniques because of its high degree of flexibility, and its ability to secure the object to be removed. In Phase I, IOS will demonstrate the concept of combining vision, illumination, and manipulation to develop an artificial ""Seeing Hand,"" using commercially available imaging optics and fiber optics, and innovative modifications to existing devices developed at UCLA. Phase I tests will establish the parameters and preliminary designs required for the overall device. In Phase II, IOS will construct and test a complete vision-assisted device for foreign bodies removal, incorporating custom- fabricated optics and computer-controlled pneumatically-actuated silicon phalanges. The ingestion of foreign bodies is a common problem worldwide, especially in the pediatric population, where more than 100,000 cases occur each year. The endoscopy technique, which is considered the gold standard for removing ingested foreign bodies, is to some degree intrinsically inefficient and unsafe, because many of the grasping type forceps that are used for this procedure are unsafe and inefficient by their nature. The development of a safer device, which employs two hands with fingers, will represent a vast improvement in foreign body removal procedures."

The use of silicon micromachining to fabricate multiple phalanges per finger, a fiber optic imaging and illuminating bundle, and micro optics will allow the entire device to fit into a two-millimeter diameter tube. This device, which will enable the precise handling of very small samples and provide immediate visual feedback to a human operator, will be an alternative to the robotic hands that provide only tactile feedback.  There will be numerous opportunities to integrate the proposed mini-manipulator technology into industrial, and particularly medical, applications.

In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology."

This algorithm will allow a network agent to determine what information is of most value to client agents onboard aircraft based on tactical objectives and the current battlefield situation. Our approach is to use Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) – a leading technique in the field of artificial intelligence – as a data structure to model the current information content of each agent in the network and determine the appropriate level of detail to transmit. As new data is received by an agent in the network, the resulting improvement in mission-specific knowledge is quantified through measures from information theory. If the change is significant, the network agent transmits the information to appropriate agents in the network. In Phase I, we will develop appropriate DBNs for representative naval missions, develop a software prototype, and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and algorithms. In Phase II, we will refine the scheme and develop a more sophisticated prototype that would allow us to demonstrate and evaluate the scheme."

The adaptive behaviors developed for the ABMAT system will be based on real-world example scenarios collected from subject matter experts with recent operational experience.  The action and reaction cycle that typifies recent operations against asymmetric adversaries will be captured from these scenarios and incorporated into the virtual experience base of the synthetic adversary models.  The resulting behaviors will adapt tactics in a given exercise both in response to events in the current exercise and in previous exercises, using a combination of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms.

ISAPA is innovative in that it is centered on a ""person-in-the-loop"" approach to automation. While ISAPA executes procedures, it asks the user for confirmations, decisions and allows the user to easily override. To increase situational awareness, the aid clearly presents, through notifications and advanced visualizations, what is being performed. The second major innovation is ISAPA's intuitive authoring tool which enables controllers (without programming skills) to build new and modify existing semi-automated procedures using drag-and-drop graphical widgets. As space station construction progresses and procedures change, authoring utilities allow the straightforward updating of procedures. ISAPA also supports gradual procedure automation, allowing flight controllers to migrate a manual procedure towards automation as confidence is gained. The system will integrate with existing mission control center systems, specifically: ""Thin Layer"" for sending commands, ""Information Sharing Protocol"" for receiving telemetry, and use official formats, such as ""PRL"", for persisting procedure data. ISAPA will also include a simulator to assist in the validation process of procedures. 

During Phase I, Stottler Henke developed a prototype of the ISAPA execution tool, authoring tool and simulation tools while constructing two sample procedures based on real-life controller procedures. During Phase II, Stottler Henke will develop a full ISAPA system ready for integration into the ISS MCC. Special emphasis will be placed on compliance with NASA ground console software certification.

ITSs have proven to be highly effective in delivering computer-based instruction, but they have historically been expensive and difficult to build, requiring specialized skill in artificial intelligence and production systems programming. Building upon Clearsighted's Phase I accomplishments, the firm will: (1) finish a fully-functional software development kit (SDK) that will allow non-cognitive scientists to create the cognitive model that powers an ITS; (2) develop technology that will enable an ITS to communicate to the vast majority of third-party software; (3) develop techniques that will allow an ITS to work with an institution's existing on-line learning system; and (4) evaluate the research team's work with respect to both time-savings in building ITSs and customers' return on investment. Two main results are anticipated: (1) a two- to three-fold decrease in the amount of time it takes to author an ITS; and (2) an estimated savings to customers of 30% per hour of the cost of traditional training time. The success of ITSs is well documented (e.g., Koedinger, Anderson, Hadley, & Mark, 1997; Corbett, 2001; Morgan & Ritter, 2002). However, ITSs have not been broadly deployed, due to the high level of expertise needed and the cost to create. Furthermore, lack of viable options to interface the cognitive model of an ITS with already existing software impairs wider dissemination of that technology. By increasing technological understanding of how to reduce the amount of the expertise needed to create an ITS and how to accomplish interfacing ITSs with existing software, the result of this supported work will be a wider distribution of ITSs. Clearsighted is well poised to become a market leader in on-line technical training by leveraging this technology. Clearsighted has partnered with Carnegie Learning, the ITS leader in K-12 education to assist in these goals, and it has the additional expertise needed to perform the required work. By transitioning ITS technology from its currently very small market to a wider audience that includes not only education, but also corporate and industrial applications, the costs to the many companies and institutions that do on-line training will greatly decrease, and the productivity of their workers will increase."

This lack of interoperability can lead to delays in the prosecution of a target. By contrast, a Service Oriented Architecture that could be successfully integrated with legacy ISR systems, and that could be extensible and adaptable for future expansion and connection with the Global information Grid, would provide the means for rapid, real-time dissemination of intelligence to warfighters. Couple this faster information dissemination with artificial intelligence that can dynamically allocate ISR resources, and the result can  provide warfighters with the information to make critical decisions in substantially less time, saving lives in the process.

A new advanced combat system design is proposed that must provide improved information management capabilities to maintain tactical control in all scenarios including high contact density environments and optimally employ improved sensors, weapons, vehicles, and tactics needed to counter advanced threats.  Each function within the new future combat system will be fully defined in terms of expected input data types, quality and rates and required output data that will be used in other functions. Physical models will also be described for each of the new functions.

Existing automatic speech generation technology, largely based on piecing together components of pre-recorded voice, is optimized for efficiency instead of sound quality.  Even the best synthetic voices, though intelligible, sound artificial and jarring. Quality issues, combined with a lack of variety and prosody control, have prevented the wider deployment of synthetic speech in computers, telephony interfaces and assistive devices, and expansion into new markets, such as video games and computer animation. This project seeks to transform two vital aspects of speech synthesis: phoneme-to-audio conversion and voice customization. Phoneme-to-audio conversion is improved by emulating the human sound production mechanism through simulation of the human vocal tract.  A basic model using MRI images is constructed and adjusted for each sound using 3D animation techniques.  Airflow within the vocal tract is computed using a fluid dynamics tool. This airflow pattern, coupled with specialized signal processing, is converted into a sound waveform. Speech synthesized in this manner is expected to sound more natural.  This approach also allows parametric voice customization. By adjusting the physical model of the simulated vocal tract, the voice can be made flat or sonorous, shrill or deep, and hoarse or mellifluous.  This feature provides a variety of voices.  The proposed technology has a broad set of commercial applications categorized as follows:   (1)  Human-computer interaction is the chief market for speech synthesis products. The largest application in this category is automated telephony services. Other applications include spoken interfaces for personal computers, digital assistants, and automotive navigation. All these applications require natural sounding voices to improve the customer experience. (2) Speech synthesis is used as an adaptive technology for the speech, hearing, and visually impaired. Both voice quality and customization are key to broadening the range and usefulness of assistive products. (3) Content creation is a newly addressable market with high quality speech synthesis. Video games and computer animations typically need a large variety of voices.  Hiring voice talent is prohibitively expensive for smaller companies and artists. The proposed technology provides a convenient tool to incorporate natural sounding voices into games, animations, and education material at a reasonable cost.  Beyond commercial applications, this technology is a valuable tool for several current research areas including speech disorders, linguistics, and speech physiology. Finally, this is a small piece required for the creation of a total simulation of the human body, a goal rigorously pursued in both academia and public health institutions."

Filling this need defines the vision underlying Acquisition Decision Expert Planning Technology for Modernization (ADEPT-M). Our approach to realizing ADEPT-M draws on our extensive experience building and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools including decision-aids, planners, simulations, and knowledge management environments for military problems.  It also draws on our proven capability integrating core visualization, knowledge representation, inference, and intelligent behavior control capabilities in web-based environments to support distributed work.

The prevalence of modern light detectors has ushered in a golden age for astronomy due to their outstanding characteristics. However, their high-fidelity nature does not help in disentangling the images of objects blended together in crowded fields. While powerful techniques have been developed to solve this problem, they are cumbersome to use, requiring substantial human and computational effort. What is needed is an optimized automated software package that can be routinely used by the astronomical community. This proposal focuses on furthering the development of advanced artificial star tests, and making the resulting suite of tools available to the wider community. In addition to this modeling and simulation work the company will collect and analyze validation data and develop a graphical user interface to increase the usability of the software.  The software developed during this project will be comprised of largely public domain and/or open source scientific routines with a proprietary graphical user interface. The company will assess the economic opportunities for producing training materials for the increasingly sophisticated amateur astronomical community. Placing powerful tools in the hands of near-professional amateur astronomers will further raise the value of their contributions to science. Additional related software products may also be developed to both educate and guide amateur astronomers who already use high quality digital CCD cameras in their home and club observatories. The company is also investigating opportunities for using these techniques in satellite imagery analysis for both commercial and military applications to terrestrial data. As commercial satellite imaging expands to a multibillion dollar per year industry, advanced analysis tools become increasingly valuable. Likewise, the military's increasing dependence upon optical and hyper-spectral imagery suggests that the ability to analyze images near their resolution limit will remain an essential strategic and tactical requirement. Portions of this work may be applicable to these Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) activities."

Here, we propose a system for Sensor Network Optimization using Multi-Agent Negotiation (SNOMAN) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. The negotiation mechanism and bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the multi-agent negotiation process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. Negotiation works continuously, providing dynamic adaptation to changes in the mission environment. Negotiation also minimizes communication resource requirements, ensuring that the system scales well to more complex sensor networks."

Intelligent Tutoring Systems have proven to be highly effective in delivering computer-based instruction, but have historically been expensive and difficult to build, requiring specialized skill in Artificial Intelligence and production systems programming.  This proposal describes a Software Development Kit (SDK) composed of four components:  Cognitive Model Authoring, Problem Authoring,   Tool Authoring, and Curriculum Authoring.  The proposed research activity centers on the first of these components:  Cognitive Model Authoring.  Cognitive Model Authoring is comprised of three separate steps:  defining an object hierarchy, defining the goal structure of the problem task, and representing the behavior of the instructional system.  The proposal is to define an object-oriented visualization of these steps, so that non-cognitive scientists can create cognitive tutors.  This tool will decrease the amount of time it takes to author the cognitive model portion of a tutor for an experienced cognitive modeler, and it also will decrease the amount of time it takes for a new person with no cognitive modeling experience to come up to speed with creating cognitive models.  The Cognitive Tutor SDK will have two impacts: 1) easier production of new Cognitive Tutors, and hence the ability to bring them to market more quickly and 2) development of  a Software  Development  Kit that could be independently marketed, enabling other companies to produce intelligent tutors in other domains, languages, countries and markets.  There are four markets for the Cognitive Tutor SDK: internal developers, external users interested in adapting existing tutor materials for related markets (prisons, welfare-to-work programs), internal and external developers of tutors in related mathematical disciplines, and external developers of tutors in other domains.  The emphasis on accountability in education provides a strong market need for effective instruction, which should help drive the desire for proven technology like Intelligent Tutoring Systems."

The tool envisions a graphical editing environment that reads in data, allows the user to modify it, and writes it out again. It reads in the "".ing"" file together with industry-standard file formats for specifying 3D models, animations, textures, sounds, etc. It allows the user to compose characters and to author their behavioral specifications through a set of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Editors.

Toward this end, Professor Asok Ray at Penn-State University has pioneered an elaborate mathematical theory based on symbolic time series analysis (STSA), statistical mechanics, and information theory.  An anomaly detection algorithm is formulated by applying this novel STSA theory to create a robust statistical pattern recognition technique. For anomaly detection, this STSA technique has been shown to be superior to conventional pattern recognition techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and principal component analysis (PCA) because it exploits a common physical fact underling most anomalies which conventional techniques do not. This superiority has recently been demonstrated on electrical circuits, fatigue testing machines, and mechanical components undergoing fatigue due to vibrations. The research objectives are: (i) to develop a coupling model where gradually evolving damage phenomena can be introduced, (ii) to formulate and compare real-time algorithms for early detection and monitoring of failure precursors in model simulations based on three principal techniques and their variants - STSA, ANN, and PCA, and (iii) to demonstrate these algorithms on fatigue damage accumulating parts of a vibrating machine experiment."

Cruz of the Ohio State University (OSU), have proposed to systemically explore differential pursuit-evasion games with multiple pursuers and evaders. Our Phase I results have shown the theoretical possibility of rigorous formulation, analysis and solutions for stochastic differential Pursuit-evasion games involving multiple pursuers and evaders. The systematic approach enables us to connect this novel approach to the existing theories in pursuit-evasion games and general dynamic games. Up to now, step by step we have extended the existing theory on deterministic PE games with single purser and single evader to more a general game problem involving multiple players under uncertainty. However, in each step the problem can be further investigated in more theoretical depth. On the other hand, it is clear that stochastic pursuit-evasion game problem spans a wide range covering various fields in optimal control, dynamic game, filtering, tracking, artificial intelligence and cooperative control.  Our Primary Phase II objective is to synthesize the newly proposed multiple players stochastic game theorems with the existing theories to create an efficient computational package for practical problems."

An instrument such as the human hand is a perfect example; it is an organ for the reception of and reaction to tactile stimuli, a perception that guides the repertoire of manual functions. However, the integration of an analogous sensing suite into a robotic platform poses a major technological challenge. The ""smart skin"" solution IFOS proposes is 2-D sensor based on the integration of high-sensitivity embedded Fiber Bragg grating (FBG), a custom engineered composite material - Nano Particle Material (NPM) ? and data interpretation and on-board decision-making. This sensor will support multi-point strain sensing to control the force exerted by robot end-effectors or manipulators on an object, required by such operations as assembly, surface-machining and cutting. Our goal is design and control of an anthropomorphic manipulation prototype based on high-resolution artificial taction. Optical sensors promise particular advantages for a robot that can achieve high-fidelity force control and that can operate safely in contact with astronauts. FBG sensors are robust, highly accurate, and immune to electromagnetic interference. A network of such sensors can be integrated directly into the structure or skin of an anthropomorphic robot."

This work successfully addressed several longstanding, clearly articulated needs for improved interactive educational software. A leading distributor for the U.S. and Canada, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories, as well as prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, have entered into long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. The aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired. There is a considerable need for improved educational software for science education in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum Al Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind using Internet-capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation here is the development of advanced Al tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the first Al tutoring systems that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. A formulation of an Al tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. This project can only be accomplished by working intimately with experts in education for the blind, and Quantum has arranged a number of important partnerships in this respect, for research as well as commercialization of the resulting technology, including: the National Federation of the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, Pearson Learning Group, Bartimaeus Group and Henter Mathematics."

Studies done of the responsiveness of numerous Military Treatment Facilities have highlighted the need for improvements in the scheduling process. In response to these findings, the Department of Defense has set ambitious targets for improvements in patient responsiveness, such as minimal waiting times for intake, and minimal times from appointment request to appointment date, and the ability to do same day appointments for ancillary laboratory visits.    The ability to deliver on these service commitments will hinge upon being able to not only do optimal (with respect to service commitments) scheduling amongst the units of a single MTF, but amongst facilities that are geographically dispersed. It will require the integration of appropriate patient information and integration with other existing infrastructure that facilitate the patient's ability to determine appointment times based upon their preferences. It will require interfaces that allow providers to enter appropriate business logic for their unit in natural ways, as well as facilitate the use of advance scheduling algorithms that can effectively information about resource requirements and availabilities, staff availabilities, and coverage constraints to fast appointment and resource planning.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence point to a number of approaches to scheduling that could yield significant improvements in the patient experience, if applied. We propose to investigate such approaches using our Aurora scheduling system as a core technology. We will extend this system to allow for integration with existing DOD healthcare infrastructure."

But the very things that make rule-based programming attractive-its flexibility, its introduction of complex and dynamically changing control structures-raise serious security concerns.    ATC-NY, in collaboration with Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC), will develop SPRINT, a tool to support secure programming in the rule-based language CLIPS.  SPRINT can be thought of as a sophisticated type-checker for a modest extension of CLIPS.  The extensions, which take the form of structured comments, provide a way for programmers to indicate more precise constraints on intended execution, and thereby provide ""checkable hints"" to SPRINT.  A program that passes SPRINT type checks will have eliminated many potential security flaws.  Since CLIPS is broadly similar to many other rule-based languages, we expect that the techniques and principles developed in this work will be generally applicable."

Here, we propose a system for Sensor Network Optimization using Multi-Agent Negotiation (SNOMAN) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. The negotiation mechanism and bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the multi-agent negotiation process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. Negotiation works continuously, providing dynamic adaptation to changes in the mission environment. Negotiation also minimizes communication resource requirements, ensuring that the system scales well to more complex sensor networks."

Coverity will develop and apply source code analysis checks that will automatically detect common causes of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, as well as application-specific security problems in various critical code bases.  Coverity will also detect other types of software defects, including memory and resource leaks, which affect overall reliability.     Although the idea of source code analysis is not new, the tools that have come to market are prohibitively difficult to use or fail to scale to the size of commercial applications.  Coverity's solutions successfully overcome these barriers with novel, state-of-the-art technology.  The prototype for Coverity's patent-pending source code analysis technology was originally developed by a team of researchers in the Computer Systems Lab at Stanford University.  Initial applications of this technology in the research setting resulted in the successful detection of over 2000 defects and hundreds of exploitable security holes in the Linux and OpenBSD operating systems.  Coverity's current analysis engine uses interprocedural data-flow analyses coupled with sophisticated abstraction techniques that may be used to uncover a wide range of software defects including    · Security holes  · Buffer overruns  · Memory corruption  · Memory/Resource leaks  · Deadlocks and race conditions  · API misuse  · Violations of coding standards    Unlike other tools that have surfaced over the years, Coverity's solution scales to millions of lines of code, achieves 100% path coverage, and requires no manual modifications or testing.  Coverity's technology can pinpoint hundreds to thousands of critical defects out of the box with orders of magnitude less noise than other source code analysis tools.    A unique feature of Coverity's tool is its extensibility.  Company specific rules, custom security policies, or errors detected by QA can be easily turned into checks that can be plugged into the analysis platform.  Furthermore, statistical learning and data mining techniques can be used to automatically retarget the tool to different code bases with differing coding conventions, styles and idioms."

The first step in this intervention is typically either: extensive human-directed interviews of subject-matter experts so that the knowledge can then be laboriously hand-encoded; or the training of SMEs in some highly-restricted intermediate representation.  Such systems have been costly to produce, and have typically failed to model expert knowledge to any degree of complexity outside of very narrow domains.  This failure has been a major obstacle to the development of systems that harness human reasoning with a computer's tireless attention to detail.  We propose to investigate why knowledge engineers need to be in the loop, and provide requirements and high-level design to addresses many of these problems.  Our focus will be on interfaces that operate in the SME's domain of discourse.  As a concrete example, we will be looking at a mixed graphical/textual representation of the intelligence analysis process whereby complex rules can be expressed as simple questions in a context inherited from the workflow.  Our experimentation to date has found that this representation is not only very intuitive for SMEs, but is also highly productive in comparison to more conventional rule-construction methods."

The proposed approach seeks to develop a system that functions as a middleware application and enables the maintainer to retrieve useful legacy data in a format that is most useful for the maintenance environment. By using a data mining approach that is a hybrid collection of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques along with concepts from the field of natural language processing (NLP) it is possible to extract useful information from CAMS/GO-81.

The key capabilities include: 1) making principled, effective use of both continuous and discrete features; 2) solving general inferencing tasks, wherein any subset of features may need to be inferred, given values for the remaining features; and 3) handling large feature space. The work is built on efficient learning of maximum entropy Probability Mass Functions (PMFs). Our algorithm avoids an artificial mapping of continuous features, leading to a significant edge in solving mixed feature space inference tasks. Our learning algorithm builds the PMF directly from training data and consequently does not require making any explicit conditional independence assessments as compared to Bayesian Networks (BNs).

Meshing is progressive and adaptive to any resolution and for any selected region in the scene, thus making it possible to model certain regions with high resolution while leaving the remaining parts coarse. (2) Meshing is then interleaved iteratively with registration to search for optimal alignment of overlapping 3D models by, in one case minimizing an error objective function, and in another case maximizing a similarity measure for aligning decomposition trees associated with the overlapping models. Following alignment, an integration algorithm fuses overlapping models. The anticipated results are effective 3D modeling and registration technologies that significantly assist NASA?s R&D mission."

These factors allow ultrasound to be particularly suitable for battlefield imaging and diagnoses. However, the modest display technology and lack of intelligent systems do not allow battlefield ultrasound to live up to its true potential.  In this work, UtopiaCompression proposes the development of a novel three-dimensional hand-held display device and analysis package that is powered by artificial intelligence and highly sophisticated adaptive models of external and internal anatomy that will dramatically increase the diagnostic power of battlefield ultrasound.  Using this non-invasive diagnostice imaging technology, a medic would be able to gain and utilize information that is currently either unappreciated or simply unavailable.  The power of this medical diagnostic imaging system stems from its adaptive capabilities and its intelligence in localizing anatomy of interest with respect to certain anatomic landmarks and displaying and recognizing known patterns and classifications of normal and abnormal anatomy.  Furthermore, given this intelligence at display and localization and the ability of the system to guide even inexperienced users to acquire diagnostically useful views, the training times of medics performing medical ultrasound on the battlefield should be greatly reduced.  Overall, this system should allow a low cost, highly efficient, and well integrated diagnostic ultrasound system whereby the user is more efficiently engaged with the scanning hardware and imaging tasks. The anticipated result of this research is to produce a user friendly intelligent visual anatomic guidance/decision support system/device backed by an effective 3D modeling and visualization technology that can significantly assist army medics in their ultrasound training and decision making."

Fighting in new and innovative ways requires thinking in new and innovative ways. New wargaming training tools are required to assist friendlyforces to be proactive and enabling potential attacks to be prevented. These tools must be able to swiftly create and assess potential threat and counter-measure scenarios. For several years, Hexagon Interactive has been developing innovative AI technologyfor AFOSR to automate the creation and assessment of friendly and adversarial potential Courses of Actions (COAs). The AI simulates the decision-making processes of human organizations/populations under conditions of stress and hence provides probabilisticpredictions of their behavior in response to inputs.This Phase I proposes to conduct additional research and implement it in a computer simulation called CYBERWAR XXI ready for verification and validation testing as part of a future effort. The testscenario that Hexagon has been working on since 1998 is Near Future Iraq War.  CYBERWAR XXI expands the definition of weapons system to include not only conventional but also unconventional and unorthodox weapons systems required in asymmetric and operations other than war (OOTW). Taking into account PMESII (Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure and Information), CYBERWAR XXI enables multiple players to roleplay at the strategic level, the National Command Authorities of variouswestern alliance and middle-east nations as well as terrorist organizations.   Increased use of conflict simulations in peacetime training for orders development would help officers execute the staff wargame in a more objective fashion, giving theircommander a better product. Networking technology can enable commanders and staff officers to quickly link their computers for a networked conflict simulation for training and COA development.Since the product is easy to use and will run on easily accessible commercial hardware, it can be used as a training tool providing an inexpensive and easily utilized means of teaching and understanding modern strategic-operational level warfare. Such atool will be invaluable for training personnel in the novel decision-making processes required by asymmetrical and other unconventional modes of warfare.The fully-developed Artificial Intelligence technology will also be a valuable product which will be useful to other DoD programs such as counter-terrorism. Simulations are also a critical part of modern weapons systems developments. They have manyadvantages, including the exploration of alternate strategies and tactics in which these weapons systems can be used, and the prediction of countermeasures, which may in turn be neutralized. Simulations have advantages in saving time, space, manpower andcosts in the training of personnel. They can also be used by policy makers and strategists to determine alternative strategies and tactics.The AI's ability to model organizational decision-making and cascading effects will be useful in a variety of civilian and business training applications. Disaster relief planners can use the tool to simulate the effects of disasters (natural and man-made)on civilian infrastructure in order to help train decision-makers and responders to maximize the efficiency of their relief operations.Markets for the technology include the US and its allies, including friendly professional military education programs, both in residence and distance learning, as well as US and international college defense studies programs.The potential commercial market is enormous. Using the predictive AI technology in commercial products designed to help corporations analyze their management decision-making processes will make them more efficient and to help them get inside thedecision-making loop of competitors. Businesses will be able to simulate areas of management through the advanced AI autonomous agents in order to predict how best to organize and manage their resources. The engine will also be available for license tocreate entertainment and business strategy games that are currently unavailable in the commercial market. Last year, this represented a 6.9 billion dollar market."

However, the development of AI (artificial intelligence) for thesesoftware packages has lagged due to the inherent difficulties in interpreting and managing increasingly complex situations.At the same time, however, the increased complexity of the game system makes a reasonably competent and challenging AI more important than ever, principally becasue it makes operating the game much more difficult for human players.  Thus, in order for theprogram to be accessible, let alone fun and enjoyable, requires that the AI be capable of assisting the player in a wide range of situations.Competent AI also serves the function of being able to provide users of the software with an effective training and learning tool.  By being able to act like a live human opponent, players can see the results or their actions and strategies in a much morerealistic real-world environment, without requiring the time, potential inconvenience or personnel investment required in a multi-human player situation.  The primary benefits of the proposed AI improvements will be that existing and future combat simulations and computer wargames will be more accurate in terms of friendly and enemy force actions, will offer more challenges to players, and will also bemore enjoyable to play.  All of which will increase the overall use of the software in whatever professional capacity it is used, be it as a training tool, an evaluation platform for weapons system or tactics development, or even as a information device toshowcase the effectiveness of new technologies.The commercial benefits from developing an impoved AI along the lines of this proposal are that computer games will become more enjoyable to play, increasing sales, as well as offering developers the opportunity to easily and quickly adjust computer AImodels for specific situations without having to rewrite significant portions of the AI modeling code.  For example, by devising and adjusting a set of standard AI customization values , the differences in the decisions between German, US or Sovietcommanders in World War II can be reflected, resulting in a better game with much less game development time than is currently required."

But with automated intelligent interpretation of the imagery we can track and classifymoving objects of interest, collect spatial and temporal motion statistics, and detect anomalous behaviors. We propose to transition image understanding (IU) technologies developed at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab into VSAM systems under development byALPHATECH, Inc. to achieve robust scene interpretation capabilities. Our plan to accomplish this technology transition consists of leveraging high performance motion segmentation, tracking, and classification techniques, identifying their benefits andlimitations, developing application-oriented end-to-end modular system designs, and developing and executing VSAM performance characterization methods. We target unstructured outdoor and indoor monitoring applications in which complete access control isnot feasible. Video-based scene interpretation provides a low-cost information-rich data source that allows us to dynamically characterize activities in these scenes according to both the spatial properties and temporal properties of objects in the scene.By using robust and adaptable video processing technology we achieve effective scene monitoring performance across a wide range of viewing conditions.  We are developing products for (1) security applications, detecting suspicious activity by identifyingtraffic pattern anomalies or by measuring loitering statistics in sensitive regions of interest; (2) traffic flow monitoring, providing live traffic flow feeds, comprising speed and count statistics, for municipal government agencies; and (3) activitycharacterization, defining average traffic patterns as a function of location and time for characterizing shopper preferences and travel bottlenecks."

One method of alleviating difficulties is by adapting AI/ES technologies to establish a user-friendly pre-processor.

Stottler ,,(415) 595-1692,,,,,,"The current Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) OPFOR does not provide a realistic interactive opponent for the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT).  This problem exists because the SAF in CATT only encodes Soviet doctrine utilized in Central Europe.  The U.S. Army does not anticipate meeting an army based on Soviet doctrine in Central Europe, therefore the U.S. Army requires a more varied SAF OPFOR.  The unbounded domain of all potential infantry actions precludes an exhaustive state space search for deriving the optimal tactics, so a modern SAF OPFOR should be based on the varied doctrines and terrains that exist in the world.  To do this, requires artificial intelligence techniques for the rapid implementation and merging or tactics from a large pool of possibilities.  The best potential tactics are dependent on weather, equipment, terrain, and may other factors.  The amalgamation and choice of tactics will give an effective an unpredictabe SAF OPFOR based on the conditions and the equipment OPFOR is given.  Friendly SAFs must also behave in a realistic manner in a wide variety of situations for an effective training experience, so for all SAFs, a rapid easy method of producing realistic behavior must be achieved.  In addition to CCTT, other simulations, including DIVE will require automated infantry agents. SHAI and RDC are already will acquainted with these projects and the capabilities necessary in SAF for an effective training environment.  The prototype automated agents proposed could be interfaced to either simulation or any other simulation at the Army's request.  In addition the mechanism for rapid production of agents proposed could be used for future simulations and future modules of existing systems."

To achieve this goal, a design study will be conducted during Phase I of this SBIR contract. Three objectives will be satisfied during the design study phase: first, acoustic and nonacoustic sensor technologies will be Identified and characterized (i.e., report timeliness coverage, etc.) to determine mission applicability; next, hybrid neural network and AI applications will be defined to provide automated detection, classification, and localization estimates to an operationally proven multihypothesis fusion algorithm; finally, the multihypothesis fusion algorithm will be modified to provide final classification and localization estimates using sensor-level detection data from dissimilar types of sensors.

THE KEY CAE TOOLS TO SPECIFY THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT METHODODOLOGIES FOR THEIR EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION WILL BE DESIGNED. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP A NEW METHODOLOGY IN WHICH AI METHODS ARE USED IN PARALLEL WITH OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS FOR MACHINE LEARNING, ADAPTIVE CONTROL, AND MACHINE VISION. A SIMPLE ROBOT SIMULATION TEST-BED WILL BE USED TO TEST THE CONCEPTS. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL OUTLINE FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS."

THERE ARE APPLICATIONS FOR KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN AND LIFE CYCLE OF ANY COMPLEX SYSTEM. DESIGN-FOR-TESTIBILITY AND INTELLIGENT BUILLT-IN TEST ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF AI APPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE SYSTEMS OR THOSE IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE ALSO MANY APPLICATIONS FOR ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS. EXPERT SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE AND DISSEMINATE EXPERTISE, INTEGRATE A WIDE VARIETY OF KNOWLEDGE TYPES, INCLUDING EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES, HEURISTIC RULES OF THUMB, AND DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF THE SYMPTONS IN BRINGING A WIDE VARIETY OF LOGICAL TECHNIQUES TO THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS. AN UNDERSTANDING OF STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF OBSERVED FAULTS. OPTICAL TEST SEQUENCING AND MINIMIZATION ARE ALSO GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE USE OF AI TECHNIQUES. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THE APPLICATION OF AI TO DIAGNOSTICS HAS LARGELY BEEN IN AN EXPERIMENTAL OFF-LINE FASHION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE LINKING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH WILL ALLOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO ACCESS A WIDE RANGE OF STANDARD BUS-DRIVEN INSTRUMENTATION AND ATLAS COMPATIBLE AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT. THESE LINKS WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF ANY NUMBER OF AI TECHNIQUES TO THE SOLUTION OF REAL WORLD MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS. IN ADDITION, AI OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR FAST IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN ATLAS, THE MOST WIDELY USED TEST EQUIPMENT CONTROL LANGUAGE."
